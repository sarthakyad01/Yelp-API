{"Review Text":"My friend and I wanted to catch up over dinner on a Saturday evening, and she picked this place (as she read great reviews). We didn't have a reservation, so we waited in line and the friendly staff at the front took down one of our names. Then we were informed that it would be about . While waiting, we looked around- the vibe was energetic and fun, the customers were eating and laughing. The decor was cool- the lights were dimmed, there were various colourful objects all around to evoke a comfy feel. I thought the place was pretty small, until our name was called and we were led to a table by a friendly young lady. The place was huge- there were multiple sections and each section had its own decor! Our seat was at the end section, where the decor reminded us of sitting inside someone's home. Our server was a second friendly young lady. She warmly greeted us and showed us the menu (QR code). She said she'll be back to take our order in a few minutes. To start, we ordered Shrimp Chips and two Thai Ice Tea. For the main, I picked Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken. My friend chose Khao Soi with beef. A few minutes later, the Shrimp Chips and two Thai Ice Tea came to us. The Shrimp Chips were delicious- they were crispy and lightly salty. The Thai Ice Tea was tasty- it tasted like milk tea with deeper tea flavour. Then our mains came and we couldn't wait to eat! For my meal, the blend of veggies, chewy noodles, and the chicken pieces were delicious- however it was a bit salty. My friend enjoyed her meal as well- she said that she liked the smooth coconut curry with blend of spices and the juicy pieces of beef. Throughout our meal, our server came by to check-in on us to make sure that we had everything we needed. The portions were generous and the dishes and drinks were delicious! Highly recommended!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"- excellent chips! - pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with  - fried shrimp was excellent - really good pineapple juice The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks. Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless. Shame there was no thai iced coffee.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy. On the positive side the server was good. Don't know if I would return.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Friday night dinner. Tried to book . They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in . Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy. We are group of 5. Ordered Food: # THAI CHICKEN WINGS # GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters ) # MOO PING (grilled pork skewers) # GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken) # GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef) # PAD SEE EW (Shrimp) Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli). The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick. The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as \"wow\". Drinks (Cocktails) # GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.) # THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower) # RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime) All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick. The amount of food were perfect for . Will come back!!!!!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"The place was decorated really well with a tropical theme. It was about an hour wait for our party of . The waiting area is very small, most of my family had to stand. I ordered the chaing Mai beef noodle soup, they give you a good amount of meat, and it was very flavorful. I tried my boyfriend's Khao soi (chicken and noodles in coconut milk curry) and it was so creamy, it the best thing I had eaten all month. I recommend dining here, and definitely make a reservation ahead of time.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened! We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy! Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick. I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too! I also wish this place had more variety of food items since it didn't feel like much variety when I went.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Hubby and I saw this place on YouTube's \"Worth It\" and we were curious and had to try this place out. Is it all hype or is it \"Worth It?\" I loved the Mango Slaw as I found it refreshing. I loved the textures of the sweetness of the mangos with the crunchiness of the taro sticks and peanuts. It is a must get, in my book. Hubby and I decided to go vegetarian for our entrees. Hubby ordered Tofu Pad Gra Prow which was very good while I ordered Tofu Khao Soi. There was a perfect balance between the curry and soup. The harmonious coconut milk with the stock made it the standout dish with its refreshing combination of flavors and textures. I truly appreciate the notion that they offer plenty of vegetarian food and can make any dish vegan. This is a trendy place and you should make reservations on Friday nights as well as the weekends. The service was fast and efficient. They offer dinner specials but the waitress explained everyone at the table would have to order it in order for it to come into effect. The ambiance with live bands on weekends and the overall trendy atmosphere adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the dining experience. So the question remains, \"Is it Worth It?\" The answer is unequivocally, \"YES!\" It definitely lived up to the hype for us.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"We dropped by last Monday. I had an out of town guest from London, UK. Very friendly staff. We got there shortly after . Got a high table up front. We were fine with it. Food was mostly great except for the suckling pig that was not suckling pig to me, the Chinese and my guest who is British Indian & lived in Asia. We get the skin was crispy but the pork itself was ham - nothing else would remind us of suckling pig. We much preferred the beans and sides that came with it. Everything else we had were delicious. From the the duck confit app, gem salad, mushroom app, and spiced sticky toffee pudding was praised by the British guest who enjoyed this version of their national dessert. They had sufficient staff checking on us throughout the evening that were always friendly. The time we did need them to take our food \/ drink order we did have to wait (awkward). Overall we had a very pleasant dinner catch up there.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"A wonderful experience with innovative and delicious twists on classics and an amazing staff who are helpful and incredibly knowledgeable on both the dishes and drink pairings.  You have the option of the Tasting Menu or A La Carte.  We opted for the a la carte and were quite happy with the chicken duo, burger, and agnolotti.  The agnolotti is the must-try hidden gem - the textures and flavors blend beautifully together and the pasta pillows literally melt in your mouth with a burst of the creamy filling.  The burger is a classic and the chicken duo brought grilled and fried chicken to a new level. Definitely recommend booking a reservation here.  Tip is also included which ups the value equation as well","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Osteria Giulia is a great place to enjoy a romantic dinner with your loved one. A cozy Italian restaurant located in Yorkville. The restaurant has a minimalistic interior with blonde wood and curved limestone walls, creating a warm and intimate atmosphere. The menu focuses on Northern Italian cuisine and delicate coastal, Mediterranean flavor. The standout dishes include the stracchino-stuffed Ligurian flatbread and the squid ink spaghetti paired with Nova Scotia lobster. p.s. they have been awarded a michelin star. Have a read of their review on the michelin site, if you are curious to learn more.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This one star Michelin restaurant is super hard to secure a spot! If you're planning to visit this place, book in advanced! My favourite items were the flat bread and chestnut dessert. Note: Their menu changes seasonally.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Good food and service, but slightly more expensive than I think it's worth. This place is so great for a special occasion  - the interior feels clean and warm, and the service is fantastic! They are extremely attentive and were constantly filling out water which is a plus in my book. The food was tasty with well balanced flavors, but I felt it was overpriced...I personally feel that Italian food can only taste so good without going overboard. I would definitely recommend the veal carpaccio and ravioli doppi - very well balanced in both flavor and texture","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"While Osteria Giulia has been awarded a Michelin star, it's unlikely they'll receive a service award anytime soon. Having arrived five minutes early, they weren't ready to seat tables and we were asked to leave - no option to wait inside or at the bar, what a pain during a windy cold fall evening. Nonetheless, once we were seated, our waitress was warm and welcoming, making up for the poor first impression from the hostess. Luckily, the food didn't disappoint. The burrata e caviale ($45), although served a bit cold for my taste, was soft and fluffy, the centre creamy but doesn't ooze out upon being cut through. The simple starter was a cacophony of flavours mixing briny Italian caviar, sweet Asfodelo honey, and a smoky sourness from the Blackbird bread. That splash of sweetness from the honey was unexpected but absolutely made the dish. Pull apart the calamari ripieni con tonno ($36) before taking a bite and you'll find the delicate seafood stuffed with yellowfin tuna paste so there's a meatiness to each bite. It's topped with a puntarella and charred pepper salad, giving the calamari a refreshing crispy bite. I'm glad it wasn't overloaded with too many sauces so that the natural seafood flavours were present. In retrospect, the lorighittas al mare ($38) was too similar to the calamari. In fact, when the dish was presented, all I could see was a plate of squid rings, only to find many were circles of hand braided pasta. Our waitress explains what makes the dish special is the time intensive nature of creating the pasta, which did have a lovely bite to it. Everything is tossed in a tasty olive oil sauce with a hint of garlic, chilli, and an umami essence from anchovy. I just wish the dish had more of the bay scallops and even some spot prawns thrown in to make it taste more like a seafood pasta. I'm generally hesitant to order ravioli as it's usually a scant dish and when they are not adequately filled it can taste like you're eating pieces of dough. Osteria Giulia's ravioli doppi ($44) smartly has one side unsealed so they can be overstuffed with silky ricotta and sauce, so you get a gush of filling with each bite. Chunks of lobster and kernels of sweet corn add richness and texture to the dish. It was an impressive dish and the most memorable of the evening. This is a long review head to Gastro World for the rest.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"After having bookmarked this 1-star Michelin restaurant for far too long, I finally decided to try it. The two of us ordered a wide assortment of dishes, so much so that the regular who sat next to us applauded us for our courageous and seemingly bottomless appetites. Cavoletti - Brussels sprouts, smoked sardines, anchovy butter, pistachios. It was a unique pairing of textures and flavors. Interesting. I could appreciate the creativity behind the recipe. Polpo alla Griglia - Grilled octopus, smoked potato, soleggiati tomatoes, seaweed butter. While the octopus was tender and the dish was visually appealing, I found the blended flavors to be odd-tasting. Carre di Agnello - 8pc lamb rack, we asked for medium-rare. Came out more on the rare side and the meat was a little chewy. It was also lacking in flavour, carried only by the infused olive oil - the lamb could've used a lot more seasoning and char. Lorighittas al Mare - Hand-braided pasta, wild squid, bay scallops, chili, garlic, anchovy. Flavour was good and pasta was al dente. Unfortunate that the portions were rather small for $38. Spaghettoni ai Ricci Di Mare - Spaghetti, BC sea urchin, soleggiati tomatoes, pangrattato. I was most looking forward to this dish and most disappointed by it. Only 1-. Though orange in color, the sauce did not taste of uni and instead, was completely overwhelmed by cheesiness. I got sick of its single-tone flavour and heaviness by my last bite. Overall, did I appreciate the dining experience and culinary innovation? For the most part, yes. Would I say there were any dishes that were memorable and that I would crave again? Unfortunately, no.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Upscale Italian fare with impeccable service, food and ambiance. Came here for a special occasion on a Monday with resos. 5pm. It was bumpin'. Full house. Space is loud so be ready to talk over other tables. Food: Focaccia di recco - flatbread stuffed with cheese and sea salt.  Probably one of my favorite dishes. Can't go wrong with cheese and bread. Vitello tonnato - veal carpaccio with cr\u00e8me fresh and capers. Meaty, creamy, delicious. Spaghetti ai Ricci di mare - sea urchin (uni) pasta - what a delight. Rich and creamy uni in a carbonara type sauce. The level of concentrated flavor in this dish is unmatched. Frutti di mare alla griglia - grilled seafood platter for two. Octopus, monk fish, White Sea bass, jumbo prawn, tiger prawn, scallops. Great for sharing or even eat it yourself if you want to indulge. Excellent variety as each one was cooked differently from the other. The monk fish skin was a little tough though. Not a meal I can eat daily otherwise I would die from the richness of the dishes Overall good experience. Would come again. No parking, look for street parking on Bernard street or Davenport. 4.5\/5","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"My sister and her partner took me here for my birthday. I heard you have to make book a table , and they're closed on Thursdays. I was excited to try this restaurant; they received a one Michelin star,and they're known for their seafood dishes. It is a must to get their focaccia bread! It's completely different than a normal focaccia bread we're familiar with. It's basically a flat bread with melted cheese and it was delicious. Their branzino was the best dish of the night as well as their clam pasta. The seafood is all cooked to perfection. The service was good, and the ambiance of the place was modern and clean. Their calamari pasta was unique because the pasta is braided; however, I prefer the clam pasta. Next time, I would try their seafood platter. I heard the platter is amazing! Overall, an amazing night and great way to celebrate my birthday.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This was a great find! So different than other stuff I typically would run across even among Mediterranean food. The fried eggplant was delicious and unique. It was almost like the same type of batter than I would find at Gus' World Famous Fried Chicken. But on eggplant. Yum. The tiger shrimp were tasty and the sauce it comes with goes well. . Wagyu lahmeh had good flavor and I woudl totally get it again. Just wish it was a little bigger - only . The black truffle rice is the priciest side but definitely something you would have a hard time finding elsewhere. Just get it. Short rib kebab very tender and better size than I anticipated. The fried chicken has similar-ish batter to the eggplant - delicious and hefty portions. Ambiance was quite chill. Service was good. Would come back for sure!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"First, I cannot give this restaurant five stars because it was impossible to make reservations through their website. We called ahead and left a voice message as our crew decided to head over after work on Friday night for a happy hour\/small plate dinner. Upon arrival, we were informed that they do not take reservations over the phone and that we would have had to make them via Open Table. When I looked at the restaurant's website, the reservations tab did not indicate that reservations were only taken through Open Table. In fact, I could not find the link for Open Table on the web page. We were seated upstairs at the bar and the bar tender was out of this world great. I ordered the Mediterrean Mule without the honey. He was very accommodating and after I disclosed my food allergies, he would not let me dig into my plat of maple roasted beets until he verified that the glaze had no honey in it. After the initial snafu at the door, the experience was great, the company was outstanding, and the food was great. I would say that the price is a lot left to be desired, however, the flavor was awesome for the small plates and the cocktails each of us had.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Hidden beside the Story building, one might have trouble finding it. Also it's located in a basement. The decor is great to admire. The washroom was nice and clean. The server was friendly, knowledgeable, and filled up our cups repeatedly with water. With such high reviews, I went in with high expectations. However, I was definitely disappointed. For the price point, food items were small and all came out cold in temperature. The dip with the bread was alright but they could have given more bread since we had lots of dip leftover to use with other food. The beef dishes were a disappointment. The worse was the pide which was burned!!! Nothing much stood out. The company was the best part as we tried this restaurant. I wouldn't go back.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I am very happy with my experience with Byblos Downtown! I reserved a table online for dinner. When we arrived, we were seated upstairs, and I loved the decor and furnishings. It has a very cozy feeling but is still classy. Our server was very sweet and offered some great drink recommendations, and we ended up ordering a few dishes to share. Our favorites of the night were: the Turkish Manti Dumplings and the Middle Eastern Fried Chicken. I also absolutely loved their Marrakesh Garden cocktail. The refreshing cucumber taste was excellent.   I would highly recommend Byblos for a chic dinner out. They really know how to make an occasion special.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Very solid mediterranean option in Downtown with friendly staff and excellent fare.  The short rib kebab is a must -try - so flavroful and succulent; the meat is thinly sliced and then reassembled into a kebab shape.  This was probably the best dish of the night.  The sunchoke and truffle salad is a great starter - and helps cut through any of the heavier dishes.  The octopus and manti are solid but not as \"wow\" as the short rib. The staff are very helpful and friendly - and the food comes pretty quickly.  Seating is also spacious and comfortable in a dimly-lit ambiance.  Worth a visit!","Sentiment":"positive"}

The food just kept getting better and better as the dishes came to us. I don't think you can go wrong with their menu. My favorite was the short ribs that were cut like an accordion with truffle sauce. It was perfectly cooked and crispy at the top. The lamb shoulder was a close second for favorite thing and comes with wraps and little sauces.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Our waiter was extremely friendly and welcoming even though he was extremely busy. We started off with Mamma Laura's famous meatballs, and let me tell you, the dish was true to the name. In this case, my phone did not eat first. The aroma of the freshly cut herbs, Parmesan cheese, and homemade marinara sauce were an absolute seller. For my main course, I ordered the Calamrai aka Griglia. This was the dish that sold my experience. The Mediterranean seasoning had the perfect amount of salt that coupled well with the squid. It was beautiful, filling, and exactly the kind of seafood option that I wish every Italian restaurant had.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Decided to splurge and celebrate a birthday here. For a fine dining experience, where apparently many celebrities like to go, this place was so very disappointing! They must either serve the \"rich and famous\" something completely different or the \"rich and famous\" have no concept of what excellent food is. Our server was fantastic; however, you could tell they were very short staffed as he and the busboy were very hurried. When our server came to our table, he was very friendly and wonderful. Too bad he did not come by that often. He did mention that they were short staffed and that the kitchen was very busy. A few times the busboy would almost throw our cutlery down on the table when resetting for the next course. He was also not consistent in setting down the cutlery. Knives facing different directions for each person or spoons on different sides of the knife or fork. Normally I would not care that much but when I go to a fine dining restaurant, I expect to receive a fine dining experience. The main reason for coming here was to have exceptional Italian food. The food itself was mostly good but it wasn't mind blowing in anyway and did not inspire us to to come back. Especially not for the prices this place was charging. Here's what we had: * Frittura Mista Di Pesce- Buttermilk-battered and deep fried shrimp and calamari with tartare sauce - the oil was clean and everything was fresh. It's deep fried calamari and shrimp, nothing overly complicated. * Polpo Alla Puttanesca - Grilled octopus served with cherry tomatoes from Pachino, black olives, anchovies and capers from Pantelleria - the octopus was grilled well and not over done. The tomatoes were nice and fresh. It was good but not the best I've had. * Carpaccio Di Filetto Di Manzo Con Tartufo Nero Di Norcia E Stracciatella Di Burrata - Tomatoes with fresh black truffle from Norcia and burrata Stracciatella cheese - one of the most disappointing dishes! The Burrata was served to us too cold and the creamy centre wasn't creamy at all. Made me wonder if we even got Burrata or if we got Mozzarella. There is a difference! * Fettuccine Alla Bolognese Di Mamma Laura - \"Little Ribbon\" fettucine with Mamma's famous fresh homemade meat sauce - simple dish of pasta noodles with meat sauce. It was quite bland. I think the kitchen forgot the salt. * La Carbonara - Artisanal Zaccagni spaghetti tossed with crispy pork cheek from Amatrice, eggs, Sarawak black pepper and Roman *DOP Pecorino cheese - the sauce on this dish was  well seasoned and quite delicious! However, the spaghetti was undercooked. It wasn't al dente, it was undercooked. When we finally had a chance to tell the server, he explained how the pasta chef is \"Roman\" and how the Romans feel this is how pasta should be cooked. He even mentioned that he's had many debates about this with the chef in the past. Basically we were served undercooked pasta on purpose. He suggested that next time we should let them know that we want our pasta al dente, the Italian way. Seriously? If you know this is what your kitchen is going to do, then you should inform your customers at the time of ordering. * Bistecca Alla Brace - Grilled Prime Canadian striploin with mushrooms au jus - nice huge juicy steak with a good amount of sides but nothing super special. * Costoletta Di Vitello - Grilled white provimi veal chop - tender and juicy; however, another dish served under season. Since our table was sharing everything, the kitchen cut the veal for us. * Cheesecake with fresh fruit compote, strawberry Tiramisu, Classic Italian Tiramisu, Ricotta Cheesecake with Pears and Almond Crust - the highlight of the dinner! All the desserts were delicious and presented beautifully on one large plate. Our favourite was the Ricotta Cheesecake with Pears and Almond Crust. All in all, the food was good but did not meet expectations. Since the kitchen was so slow and we were getting really hungry, we only told our server about the food experience we had after eating. There are so many other wonderful places you can go to great Italian food and a fine dining experience. This was not one of them. If you have money to burn and are into chance celebrity sightings (which we did not care about), go ahead and come here. If you want consistent, impeccable service and food that would make you want to come back the next day, go somewhere else.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Such a disappointing meal and honestly so embarrassed that I suggested this place to my friends. The carbonara was probably one of the worst we have had. It was the one pasta dish our server suggested, . The carbonara was so salty, cheesy and the pasta was so undercooked. We also suspect it to be cream base because it was so saucy, almost like soup. It was awful. We all had a few bites and left 3\/. We ordered the calamari and shrimp to start. It was fresh and pretty good. The bread was also not bad, nothing special. The service was average, our server seemed annoyed explaining the specials to us. Mid way telling us the specials, he asked if we are really interested in knowing the specials... He was quick at refilling our waters. That's probably because they don't offer tap water. So we were suckered into buying bottled water. We spent $, for four people. It's an expensive meal, which I'm honestly ok paying, if it's a good meal. This was not worth it at all, and I don't recommend.","Sentiment":"positive"}

We were offered dinner at the bar and it was absolutely the BEST experience as we were watched over by the amazing Simone. We started with Cacio e Pepe and it was to die for. My husband had the lamb shank and I had the veal chop. This veal chop was literally the best I've ever had. (See my before\/after pics) Simone directed us to the best wines by the glass (quite a nice selection). For dessert we had a torte of ricotta and stewed pears that was delicious and light. We split it but I could easily have eaten my own. Dessert was accompanied by decaf cappuccinos and I had Galliano while he had a delicious 20-year old tawny port. TOTALLY .

{"Review Text":"I'm a big fan of Susur Lee and I had been wanting to eat at Lee for a while. I finally visited for a birthday dinner and had a great time. The ambiance, service, and food were all excellent. My friends and I split three small plates\/apps, the cheeseburger spring rolls, Singapore style slaw, and Yucatan goat cheese tart. All three were great, but the slaw was the unanimous favorite. It was so light and fresh with lots of textures and, even with so many ingredients, tasted excellent all together. The cheeseburger spring rolls were the weakest in my opinion, but not to say they weren't good. Just not as flavorful as the other plates. They had a 2.'ve always wanted to try Miyazaki Wagyu. It did not disappoint! The price was surprisingly fair ($\/$) for such a stellar cut of meat. The smaller portion was still filling, especially since the meat is so rich. Melted in my mouth and was worth every bit the hype. It came with pickled radish (a favorite of mine), parmesan frites, and daikon with mustard. Every bite was so flavorful and I left very satisfied. We also split the All Time Favorites dessert tasting plate (eight pieces) and it was more than enough for us all. My favorite was the tong yuen, it tasted like a fancy (and much better) Asian-inspired Ferrero Rocher. Sometimes restaurants from famous chefs don't live up to the hype, but Lee definitely does. Susur Lee is truly a magician and I'm so glad I was able to finally try his dishes. Our server, Quinn, was also excellent. The perfect amount of attentive and very friendly and knowledgable about the restaurant and menu.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I'm a big fan of Lee. Not just because Susur Lee is awesome, is the restaurant is just fantastic. An excellent sharable menu that is Chinese inspired but has lots of different flavors and a cool cocktail menu. Great for both date nights and dinner parties. Check it out if you haven't been, especially the new location is beautifully renovated.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"It used to one of my fav restaurants in the city but the food quality went down after the pandemic, the salad is their signature dish and you can eject go wrong with it I wish they kept the charsiu pecking duck as it was such a creative and delicious dish, the food still has some creative ideas but the taste is not on par with their creativity & presentation","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I went here for a company Christmas dinner, so the experience might have been slightly enhanced due to the higher budget but regardless, I had a great time and the food was absolutely delicious. We got a private room in the back and it had a really nice set up with a large table seating 20+ people. I had actually gotten surgery the day before, so I was on some medication's and had some trouble walking around but luckily the staff were very attentive to me and took good care of me. Regarding the food, we had a set course dinner, and every course was thoroughly explained. You could tell by how the servers were all talking about the dishes, and the chef, there was a high level of respect and understanding. The slaw salad was one of the dishes that I had heard about and it definitely met expectations. It was beautiful to see all the ingredients and the final product once they were all mixed together. My favourite course, lettuce cheeseburger wrap, was actually the one I forgot to take a picture of because I ate it so fast. Regardless, everything else was really delicious and I would highly recommend it to go for dinner on a date or with friends.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Celebrated my anniversary at Lee. Atmosphere was amazing but the food was even better! The server was very nice and explained the menu in detail as well as her favorite dishes. We ordered the duck confit, signature Singapore salad, and the salmon tartare tacos! The Singapore salad is a must try, it had an incredible depth to it. As a bonus we got to personally meet chef Susur Lee which was the highlight of my night.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"FOOD : 9\/ : 7\/ : 8\/ : 8\/, but the drinks weren't as good -- they lacked a balanced taste and felt like the proportions between soda, liquor and the rest of ingredients wasn't correct. I tried one drink, requested to change it and the second one wasn't significantly better, but I appreciated the server's willingness to fix it. The vibe is nice, but the tables are placed way too close, and it feels uncomfortable when you hear the conversation from the next table clearly, and so do they. The service is good, up to the standards, but not outstanding. Generally would recommend for a group outing rather than a place for a date.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Pizza is good but not the best I've had. I liked the thin crust, but the flavors felt underwhelming to me. However, I thoroughly enjoyed their lasagna and Truffle pasta. It was very savory, and the portions were decent. I would come back to try more of their main entrees vs. their pizza. The servers were super friendly, and the vibes were nice!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Gusto . They have the best mushroom truffle cream pasta and that is one of the main dishes we always get here. It is such an unforgettable dish. Their pasta is cooked Al dente and paired perfectly with their creamy white truffle sauce. I always try a new pizza whenever I'm there too. I got their Salsicce pizza and it is topped with sausages, dandelion greens, chilled, pecorino cheese and garlic oil. I love how much meat was on the pizza, but I was a little too heavy for the thin crust pizza though. The service was not necessarily the best that night and I found the servers a little slow and inattentive. The ambiance was nice though: moody warm vibes, and dim lightings. Overall, I would always return back for the mushroom truffle pasta though, but not necessarily for the service though.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I had been wanting to try Gusto for a while and finally went for my anniversary dinner. I had made a reservation earlier in the week through OpenTable and wanted to make sure our table would still be available since we were running quite late. I was disappointed at the lack of communication by the restaurant staff as I tried calling multiple times but was unable to reach anyone. I messaged on OpenTable and did not get a response either. While being late is completely on me as the diner, it seems quite unprofessional that no one picked up the phone despite their own reservation policies. When we got there, the restaurant was already very busy on a Saturday night. The ambience was loud and lively, and the decor matched the vibes. We were given a table upstairs right at the doorway and quickly realized how terrible the table was. When our server put down our bottle of water, it started sliding off the table because it was just that slanted! We asked to be moved to a better table and was promptly guided to a table downstairs. Although the rest of the evening went perfectly fine, I wonder why the restaurant staff felt that this table seating was appropriate for any diner! In terms of the food, we ordered the Burrata, a salad, the Funghi pizza and cheesecake for dessert. The burrata was delicious and great starter! The flavours and texture of the dish went perfectly together, especially the candied walnuts which gave a nice hint of sweetness. The salad was also solid but nothing much to write home about. The Funghi pizza was loaded with mushrooms; the dough was thin and the crust was soft and chewy! Very much enjoyed it. We rounded off dinner with the cheesecake which tasted a lot like a Japanese cheesecake to me in both flavour and texture. It was light and cakey at the same time; the berry compote gave a nice tartness to complement the sweet. Overall, I enjoyed the food here, portion sizes were good for two people but service could have been better. The restaurant was quite busy and our server seemed to be flustered the whole night.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I love Gusto! End up here at least once every time I'm in town. Always hits the spot no matter what time it is or what I'm in the mood for. On this particularly chilly day, we chose to sit indoors instead of our usual rooftop choice. They change their cocktail menu often & each time, I start off disappointed that they don't have what I had previously ordered, then completely loving a new cocktail. Food is great too. This time, I chose the FUNGHI (shiitake, oyster mushroom, mozzarella, taleggio, pecorino, caramelized onion) SO good! Perfectly balanced flavours & burnt crust, just the way I like it. Adored my cocktail too: L'ABETE (dillon's gin, st. germaine, apricot, grapefruit, rhubarb bitters). Absolute perfection. My guy had the GUSTO BRUNCH BURGER (cheddar, herb remoulade, caramelized onion, pickles, egg, tuscan fries) & loved it. Fries were great! He had the STELLA COMETA (wild turkey, amaretto, pineapple, lemon, spiced syrup, chocolate bitters) which was also fantastic. Big Gusto fan!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"his is a wonderful place that is really tasty. I am a non-vegan but often need to find vegan restaurants in the city for family and friends. This place is really tasty, but like all places small portions carry large price tags. If you can see past that, because eating out these last few years has become a luxury rather than just a thing to do, you'll be fine. The flavours are superb, it appeals to the vegan and non-vegan alike, and it's a great atmosphere for families or friends who want to hang out and chat.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Both of them tasted good but my favorite was the unagi Eggplant. Also got to try their five layer dessert filled with almond, raspberry\/cherry flavors. I didn't like it much as it was too sweet.

{"Review Text":"This is a trendy chain of restaurants, each with its own theme of vegan and vegetarian items. This location has an Asian fusion theMe. I found the items to be quite simple and a little bit over price for what it was. For example, you can get deep fry broccoli with Asian sauce for $15, or you can get a plate of six dumplings for $15. Having said the staff are quite friendly and delicious. It was just a little bit on the pricey end. Compared to a lot of other restaurants this is actually good value for money. It just always feels different as an East Asian person, to be eating Asian fusion when it is things you grab eating that might be quite cheap to buy served at a substantial Mark up... but it was well prepared","Sentiment":"positive"}

Japanese Sweet Potato - Only saw a bunch of cilantros on top, didn't see much sweet potatoes underneath. Teriyaki Salad - I liked the nori chips, pretty crispy, mushroom was a good ingredient too, but too much cabbage, could have added more green varieties. Would come back someday to try other dishes.

Personally I expect brunch spots to be sub par to par level with rare visit warranted space. This place rates at par especially with the value proposition. The prices are very reasonable for brunch for this area. I tried the French toast the first visit and sampled the banana waffles a little. Both are acceptable for what vegan food is. There is a surprise here and there in the taste profile as is the case with vegan food. One can order from the main menu as well. I tried the burger and fries combo both decent.

{"Review Text":"Full Disclaimer I am not a vegan by any means and was almost a carnivore for a part of my life. I have started to appreciate vegetarian items now though so enjoy a good vegetable dish. With high recommendations coming from a vegan friend who tried their food at a vegan festival not to mention a fellow yelper who I feel has a similar palate to moi I had high expectations. First the interior a nice welcoming space with good color scheme and reasonable dinnerware\/flatware. However the washrooms are located upstairs and don't have locks!! quite unnerving. We were here for a brunch so decided to order large plates and ordered an app of cauliflower tots to share. The drink list is extensive with some interesting cocktails and a few health focused drinks.  My dinning companions (DC's) and I ordered a bottle of Cava (decent) and one person stuck to Beau's beer. The app was decent (most of deep fried stuff ought to be :) Now for the main I ordered a crab cake and DC's ordered the burger. The mains took their time to arrive meanwhile we enjoyed the pleasant setup. They have the look down pat of a crab cake IMO. The first bite reminded of Japanese dish Okonomiyaki (I luv that dish) and the salad it was served on was good (nice tangy and then sweet notes) Hmm I didn't enjoy this dish as it had a lingering aftertaste. There was something heavy about this dish (the crust or the absorbed oil) that was of putting to the extent that I couldn't finish it. My DC's were OK with their burger. I tried the fries and wasn't impressed with the overwhelming paprika. I guess this place is trying to bring mainstream folks by offering faux versions of popular dishes. However in these two examples the results weren't good. I might revisit as am starting to explore this area and would try a vegan dish which is vegan in the first place. So far \/ambiance.","Sentiment":"positive"}

IT twas drowning in an orange sauce and was very oily too. 4) Ahi tuna tataki. This was the only dish that was acceptable.

I had very high hopes for it. The fried chicken seems to be everyone's favorite and I agree it had amazing texture and flavor, the dipping sauce could be improved. . The oysters covered in mayo sauce \"kaikimayo\" were decent, very creamy and had a decent flavor. The fried chicken and the oysters covered in mayo sauce were the only . The Tokyo fries were not terrible but they were just more salt heavy than other flavors it had. It had a nice presentation and when I saw it I felt like I was in for a treat but then as I ate a few bites I realized how salty it was and that really most of what I was tasting was salt. I say this was a . The salad was pretty good but the center piece should have been the tofu, why did they serve raw soggy tofu I'll never know, it was gross like gelatin, but this salad had so much potential, the dressing was flavorful and I loved it, but the tofu was supposed to be the main part, the meat substitute basically, and all they had to do was sear it so the texture was firm or fry it a bit or something. . The miso soup was extremely salty more than usual for a miso soup. , the filling inside the balls were yummy and had 't cook the octopus well so it was so chewy it wasn't edible and I had to spit it out. 2.-noteworthy. Not worth mentioning. The server was friendly , and everyone greeted you nicely. I enjoyed the vibe of the people there.","Sentiment":"positive"}

We saw the waiters running around so much we felt bad for them since we could see they were severely understaffed. Has the potential to be more of a weekend night out tapas and drinks spot vibes, but only if they become better staffed and get food out quicker. One thing I wish is that there are pictures of food on the menu since there are so many options since you're sharing this tapas-style meal with people.

Honestly every piece was delicious. Lobster, ocean trout, tamago... The dessert course is a scoop of black sesame ice cream.

This time the new things that I had is a tuna pate, lobster, mini sweet shrimp... I love how they allow me to have less rice I tired to keep it regular amount but I couldn't so I asked half the amount of rice half way. The dessert or the last piece is ways the same tamago. I love how they infuse the rice and the egg so it's nothing like ones u have outside . It's like cake but really eggy haha","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Dining at Yasu is akin to embarking on a culinary odyssey through the very heart of Japan. It's not merely about enjoying sushi; it's about witnessing an ancient art form that's both poetic and palate-pleasing. Nestled in an intimate setting, the decor at Yasu exudes a minimalistic charm that beautifully complements the Omakase experience. What truly makes Yasu a standout is the sheer mastery of the sushi chefs. With every precise slice, artful assembly, and graceful presentation, they transform the freshest, highest quality ingredients into edible masterpieces. Each course in the Omakase lineup unravels like chapters in a story, each more compelling than the last, guiding your senses through a tantalizing array of flavours and textures. The fish, always fresh and sourced from prime locations, shines in its simplicity and purity. The balance between the neta (topping) and shari (rice) is impeccable, reflecting a deep understanding and respect for the craft. The harmonious play of umami-rich flavors, gentle vinegared rice, and subtle nuances of wasabi and pickled ginger in between makes for a dance of tastes that is nothing short of spellbinding. Beyond the sushi, Yasu's service is impeccable. The staff is attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about ensuring every diner's experience is memorable. Their recommendations on sake pairings further elevate the Omakase journey. In the world of sushi, Yasu isn't just a restaurant; it's a temple where the traditions of sushi-making are both honored and innovated. For those seeking an authentic, soul-stirring Omakase experience, Yasu is nothing short of a revelation.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Came here to celebrate our first anniversary. This is an intimate dining experience that is a $. There are three sushi masters (youngest had responsibility of 2, middle had responsibility of ). Service was excellent throughout this time and our head chef seemed passionate about his food. Courses came out at a leisurely pace and I never felt rushed. We started off with a small sashimi plate with an oyster and continued through various courses of classics (scallop, salmon, tuna, etc.) and a few new things. I really enjoyed that there were a couple of new dishes I have never tried before (herring eggs on kelp and smoked bonito). We ended with a refreshing yuzu sorbet. As previously mentioned, bill may come as a sticker shock. 18% gratuity is already added on (post-tax) so you do not have to add anything additional on. Overall, a pleasant dining experience. I did see a few individuals with birthdays receive some special extra (though our anniversary wasn't mentioned, which isn't a big deal but interesting). I am glad I tried it but I will say, it is a hefty price to pay so this will not be a frequent place.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Everything we had was really fresh, making it easy to taste the different flavours of each fish. Surprisingly my favourite was the cod testicle, super creamy, no fishy flavours, subtle sweetness and very delightful to eat. The monkfish liver was a good one too, again rich and decadent but not rubbery as they poached it. Well seasoned and creamy! Saba was definitely still fishy, but the fresh type with a hint of yuzu. My other favourite was rheir Bonito fish which was oven baked I belive. it was jusy really good experience overall.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"It is better to arrive early for your Yasu experience than late because they start making and serving the dishes at the same time for everyone seated at the sushi bar.  If you are late, you are making everyone wait, and in my case, i received a passive aggressive attitude from the hostess (who would have thought it would take more than an hour on the ttc from Queen and Bay to Harbord!!!) Before starting, this lovely hostess asked if we have allegies or preferences, to which i said, i don't prefer anything liver or kidney.  Her answer was, we serve only seafood, nothing land. Other than the attitude of this hostess, i really enjoyed everything else from the evening.  I liked the way the sushi chef presented each dish, telling us what they are and where each of the sea (ahem not land) animal is from.  The sashimi plate consisted of a large prawn and a couple of slices of fish.  It was visually beautiful.   And each of the sushi presented all looked and tasted different from each other. I did not walk away from this evening still hungry nor too full.  My friend said she would likely have a snack later on. I am glad i tried this omakase experience from Yasu but would likely not go back again because for the amount i paid, the only wow factor was my reaction to the hostess.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Even though the halibut was cooked very well, the flavors did not go well together. At least it came with mashed potatoes. The rib eye was even worse. The quality of the steak being thin, chewy, & fatty did not meet its price point. It also did not have a char or enough seasoning. The piece we had did not even include the rib cap.

The cocktails and glassware were quite pretty, though the taste was just average for the most part. The food all seemingly had one thing in common: the lack of cohesion. It's clear the ingredients were paired to bring various flavours to the dish, but the dish simply tasted like each ingredient separately. This was quite noticeable in each dish with exception to the steak. One dish to point out was the scallop pictured, which was definitely a little underwhelming, as it almost seems like more effort was placed on plating than the food. We also expected more than one scallop to be served at this price point. My recommendation is to come here for the view and the drinks. It's quite romantic if you appreciate the luxe vibe, though being situated near the top of TD tower may make it feel more like a business environment instead.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Got the \"Ontario Pork Jowel\"  wife got the halibut. Serious one star penalty for the almost pretentiously SMALL PORTIONS.

Give it a try if you're in the neighborhood but def skip the fresh rolls and coconut soup. Nothing about those dishes feels authentic Thai. Their Khao soi noodle is very very rich - I asked for a bit of hot water in a cup to dilute it. Overall, flavour and spice us alright.","Sentiment":"positive"}

We ordered the pad see ew, pad gra pao, and khao soi. The highlight was probably the pad see ew, it was the right amount of sweet and savory. All of the dishes were quite good; the pad gra pao had a little too much rice and not enough protein. The khao soi was the right amount of coconut-ty and curry. We ate family style and our server was nice to bring us smaller plates and bowls for sharing. I would come back to try different items on their \"regular menu\" that's not normally offered on their weekday lunch menu.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Whenever we go to the Jays game we always make a trip to Khao San Road. We absolutely enjoy the complexity of flavours and authenticity of their food. Today we didn't have to lineup to get a table. They  were serving lunch menu with still a decent selection of curry,  pad gra pow, Pad thai and Khao soi. We ordered the curry of the day: Massaman curry $13.99. We also upgraded to combo $4.. The curry has small Parisienne potatoes, peanuts, tamarind, and your choice of  chicken, pork, tofu veggie. Sub beef\/pork $1.\/fish $2.. There's a hint of sweetness from the tamarind sauce, and you can sip the broth like a soup.  So satisfying... You get a decent serving of Jasmine rice The Tom Yum soup was a delicious medley of cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and tofu. The fresh roll consisted of tofu carrots and lettuce wrapped in rice paper. Chili tamarind sauce to dip. The presentation looked beautiful on the narrow plate. Three flavours pad thai $17.:  0- no spice 1 - mild 2 - medium 3 - spicy 6 - Thai spicy 8 - Extreme thai spicy 12 - Chef top spicy.  I got it mild because I know how spicy it can get. The pad thai was perfectly assembled with crushed peanuts on top. The glass noodles were cooked with a tangy tamarind sauce with a generous serving of chicken breast meat. The portion was huge for lunch portions. We had some takeout! Service was friendly, and the server came by to check on us regularly.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for some critically acclaimed Thai food. A symphony of flavours! Well done!","Sentiment":"positive"}

It's a good portion, excellent noodle texture, and wonderful flavours. I love medium spice. Squash fritters always a tasty shareable that is generous in size. Their garlic tofu and garlic chicken are panko crusted and a good way to also start a meal. Green curry is decent. Love the vibes inside and they have a bar upstairs. Hard to get a seat for walk-in as they're popular but it's worth the wait.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"A cider bar! What a great idea. This place has a wonderful kitchen but also distinguishes itself with its expansive cider beverage selection. They've got more ciders than you thought existed. Pear cider, cherry cider, champagne cider, Thai cider, spicy cider, dessert ice cider, and um, just cider. I started with the Revel \"good evening\" cider and it was gorgeously sour, like a lime squeezed into a lemon wrapped in a tart apple. It was delicious. I would make it my summer drink if it was summer. Alas, next year. The food was fitting of a highly rated gastro pub. We started with the carrot and zucchini fritters, crispy on the outside and soft and tasty on the middle. The beet salad was fresh, with green apple and a ch\u00e8vre dressing...more apt for the summer months, like the Revel. The scallops were done just right. And they were nice and big. Finally, the fried chicken karage style were delectable with a sweet heat and juicy dark meat pieces perfectly battered and fried. We had the quince tart to close and it was a strong choice. Butter-forward but not heavy due to the light pastry and subtle flavour of stewed quince, not too sweet. Finally, what a beautiful space and great service! So cosy but also sophisticated. They have a nice back room that would be good for a private party. Her Father's Cider Bar and Kitchen is where you will find your \"cider soulmate\" and your gastropub bliss.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I teetered back and forth between 4 & .5. We ended up at Her Father's Cider Bar & Kitchen after finding out the place we were originally planning to have dinner had an hour-long wait. I'd walked past HF many times, but had never been in. The host quickly checked to see if they had space on the heated patio (our preference) and we got lucky!  They explained they were having heater issues, but it was nothing a little tape couldn't solve and we were perfectly toasty all night! We ended up sharing a cider flight (a Niagara peach Chardonnay, a KW Thai ginger, and a spruce one I can't remember). All !! The KW Thai ginger was unique and similar to kombucha so I loved it. For food, we ordered a few things to share. First was a salad with cucumber, tomato, a crab vinaigrette, feta, and roasted chickpeas. That was my favourite. The dressing was incredible. We also ordered the French fries which came with a chipotle aioli and a apple fennel ketchup. The fries were great but that ketchup was the real star!  We also tried the fried chicken which was also good!  Finally, the birria sliders which came with consomm\u00e9 for dipping. They were good but the consomm\u00e9 could have used a bit more. Service was good, but it really depended on who was stopping by. Some servers were a bit more friendly and attentive than others, but everyone was nice.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"We were looking for a nice patio on Harbord, came to this place. It started raining and we went inside. The inside is actually pretty nice. Got some drinks and a salad. The Caesar was really good. We didn't get to try any food because our waiter didn't bother to come see us at all, actually we had to go get him to order drinks even though the restaurant wasn't busy at all. He told us the kitchen will be closed in five minutes because they were transitioning between brunch and dinner. When we were leaving, a much nicer waitress told us that wasn't the case and we could've ordered. So yeah, the service wasn't good at all. I would give it another try but make sure to stay away from the young guy who looked bored and annoyed as if we were bothering him by just being there\u200d","Sentiment":"positive"}

I saw that they have flights of cider so it seems really neat that you get to try a variety of different ciders in one seating. I did eat a lot of the food though. My group shared the fish tacos that were very flavourful with just a little bit of heat. I got the arctic char as my main course. You can see from the photo it was beautifully presented with a lovely yellow bar blanc sauce, green beans, purple sweet potato. It was beautiful and delicious. We also shared their flourless chocolate cake which was delicious. It had a delicious caramel on it and it was a perfect treat to end off the night. Our server was also so lovely. She was knowledgable and sweet and funny.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Tried their truffle gnudi and lamb dumplings. As mentioned earlier, I was able to order half plate which was the right portion for me.  They also offered a complementary savory which was good. A little too late Mocktail with yolk base was yum. Must try! It wasn't easy to get a spot in the restaurant as it is always crowded and they go by reservation.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Delicious food and drinks to unwind on the weekend! We got seated on the north east side of the patio and it was gorgeous - sitting under a large tree with the patio lights made our experience. I tried their award winning cocktail \"Down by the bay\" and it was unlike anything I've ever tasted but loved it. The \"where's the smoke margarita\" was spicier than I expected and I like spice, so that threw me off a bit. Combined with the milder spiced lamb dumplings, it was a bit too much for my liking so I would avoid pairing those together. The pea pasta was extremely refreshing for a summer night and the beef cheek burger was my favourite. Overall, had an amazing time for a spontaneous Friday night out. The bill for  $150 (no dessert) a bit more than we planned to spend.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Rasa got a wonderful rustic cabin vibe going, and it pairs well with their flavourful menu. The ceviche was one of the best I've had; the Thai flavours were perfectly balanced and the seafood was incredibly fresh. And the chickpea fritters were the perfect accompaniment, with just the right amount of crunch and a delicious sauce that had my taste buds dancing with joy. The short rib and sunchokes were delicious, but the beef was definitely a bit overcooked. The attention to detail in every dish was simply incredible. Each plate was a work of art that tasted just as good as it looked. I could tell that the chefs had put a lot of thought and care into every element, from the presentation to the flavors and textures. And I have to give a special shoutout to the service team at Rasa. They were attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely seemed to care about making our dining experience the best it could be. Overall, I cannot recommend Rasa highly enough. The food is exceptional, the service is outstanding, and the overall experience is definitely well worth your money!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"This was such a wonderful experience. We ended up making a reso on the Set Monday, not really know a ton about it other than there is live music and a set menu to choose from. Reviews have been great so we thought, why not? The atmosphere is really neat. Lots of wood and it almost feels underground but in a sort of speakeasy way. Nice mood lighting, but you could still bring your mom and she could read the menu. The live music was lovely. Just the right level to enjoy it and still feel like you can chat with your dinner date. Our server was a lovely woman who was really knowledgable. Always there when you needed her and very sweet. The set menu was lovely. A total surprise but great items to pick from. The Gnodi was my favourite for sure. They are huge gnocchi with ricotta then topped with mushrooms and this wonderful gravy-like sauce and a mild pesto type sauce. I'm still thinking about it. I'm not a huge salad person but even their salad was delightful. Very fresh and bright tasting with such nice presentation.

The staff was not only professional but also incredibly warm and welcoming, making us feel like cherished guests from the moment we walked in. Now, let's talk about the food - it was simply outstanding. Each dish we ordered was a masterpiece of flavor and presentation. From the appetizers to the dessert, every bite was a culinary delight. The chef's attention to detail and commitment to quality ingredients were evident in every dish. And the location! It's a charming spot that adds to the overall ambiance. We were lucky enough to dine on the outdoor patio, which offered a lovely view and a serene atmosphere. It's the perfect place to celebrate with friends and family, whether it's a special occasion or just a casual get-together. I can't recommend this restaurant enough.

{"Review Text":"In the same spot and with the same name since , but Scaramouche has managed it by offering great service and beautiful plating with an amazing city view. The menu is consistent (if a \"\" were to be published, it wouldn't be very thick), but it's forgivable since my last visit here predated Yelp. The coconut cream pie is still the same, but since everyone orders it, perhaps a seasonal variation? (Peach-coconut in summer, chocolate-coconut in winter... but only alongside the original of course!). We began by splitting the peppercorn pasta entree ($35) as our appetizer- a brilliant move, since it's richness could overwhelm as an entree. Next the expertly executed scallops ($45), and the equally beautiful duck ($45). We both finished (of course) with the pie ($15), but wished we'd shared a single serving (it's small, but filling). To impress Michelin, an amuse course or petit-fours would help, but even without, it's still pretty star-worthy (we shall see soon enough).","Sentiment":"positive"}

The cocktail was so sweet and weak. The bread and Hummus was ok but I expected more from bread in a French restaurant. The Borata was just ok. The worst part was the main. So much butter in the food you could hardly taste anything else. We ordered medium rare steak, but it was completely rare. This restaurant is now more like a new branch of \"The Keg\", rather than what it used to be.","Sentiment":"negative"}

I would recommend making one if you plan on coming on a weekend in the evening! We arrived close to ! There is a separate food and drink menu. A karaage bucket is also available for take-out only. It helps to write down everything you want on your phone and then the server will use a tablet to take your order which makes the transaction smoother. In the restarant, there are two sides once you enter. On the left is the dimmer area with plenty of tables and chairs (almost feels like you're at a club!). There's good hip music playing as well so the atmosphere is lively for those looking to have a good night. You can also see the chefs in action as the bar seating and open kitchen is just across on the other side of the area. On the right side is where diners need to take off their shoes as it is more of a traditional Japanese seating area where you could sit with your legs crossed on a cushion. The place is great for both shareables and drinks. The sake bombs are always popular and gets the staff involved in cheering. Shareables were also delicious - my personal favourites were the original karaage and the prawn tempura. I also really liked the salmon oshizushi.","Sentiment":"positive"}

All the fish was grilled really nicely, and the pastas packed a lot of flavor. My personal favourite dish was the Leonardo spaghetti. It had a really nice simple lemon sauce that tasted amazing. For dessert we got the tiramisu the cookies and my personal favourite the lemon sorbet, which was served in a frozen lemon peel.

{"Review Text":"My overall rating is 3.5. Here is the breakdown: The food: Stuffed Olives - 4\/5 - a touch salty but lovely nevertheless. Crispy Squash - 6\/5 - this was the star of the show. We loved it! The burger - 3.5\/5 - it was a bit dry tbh. The pork - 5\/5 - it was a really good protein dish with a slight charred flavor and it came together really well. Fries - 2.5\/5 - we may have gotten an unfortunate batch of burnt ends but they left a distinct burnt taste that was unpleasant. Pie - 5\/5 - it's a massive portion that can easily feed two people and it's very good! Service: The service was lovely and attentive. They give you clean plates between meals and wipe down your table which was a nice touch. Ambiance: It's a very narrow diner style restaurant. Cute decor and nice bathrooms (note you do have to go down a flight of stairs to get to the bathrooms).","Sentiment":"positive"}

First, it was too loud. Not so loud that we had to shout to make each other heard, but loud enough to be annoying. I did ask that it be turned down, and for a while it appeared that it was, but later it intruded on us again. Worse, though, was the selection.

Additionally, I completely understand training staff; however I could hear exactly what was being taught to new members. Our server was sweet and made good recommendations. We loved the complimentary bread, stuffed olives, butternut squash, lamb ragu pappardelle. Wasn't a fan of the octopus-- was over cooked and hard to chew.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Most of the menu wow'd us: olives and scallops were delicious and interesting, the drinks were a perfect balance of sweet and boozy, and the foie gras sundae was a little bit daring and a lot of flavour. The weakest dish here though was definitely the pork secreto. It was pork without any delicious fats or herbs, and it became a fairly dry piece of meat. Staying with the rest of the menu should give you an incredible meal though. The decor is gorgeous and intimate, perfect for date night.

My friend and I came for dinner and we had to make those reservations nearly a month in advance in order to get those spots. The host seated us almost immediately and the service was pretty good overall. It definitely gives high end but also diner vibes. As for the food, we ordered , lamb ragu pappardelle and the grilled octopus. The octopus was cooked perfectly and I liked the sauce, it was flavorful but I wish I had a carb to balance it out. The pappardelle was cooked very nicely and I loved how the lamb complemented it. The lamb was tender but also a little crispy which gave the dish another level of texture. The tuna tartare and uni was good but it was a tad fishy for my liking. As for drinks, I loved that they were served in a chilled glass. I got the strawberry daiquiri and it was refreshing and perfect with my meal. Aloette is definitely on the pricier side and although I was satisfied from my meal, the portion sizes are almost tapas size.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Aloette is a vibe -- the space is fashioned like a diner but has this timelessness to it. Because the space is long & rectangular it was almost like what I imagine traveling first class by train in the gilded age would've been like: Intimate but not claustrophobia-inducing. Fancy but not overly hoity toity. I mean the tables are maroon-colored formica and it just WORKS (and makes me want it in my house lol) The 90s hip hop bumping on the speakers was the cherry on top. Now that I'm done waxing poetic about the space -- let's talk the important stuff: the food & drank! The cocktail menu is small but super creative. The bartenders also know wsup; I asked for a paper plane and they made a stellar paper plane. We had the: *Beef Tartare Crostini - fennel, egg yolk, jalape\u00f1o- great lil' bites! no complaints! *'Nduja Stuffed Olives - halloumi, sourdough, chimichurri - love the presentation on metal cocktail picks. Really nice savory bite and quite flavorful. *East Coast Oysters - tiger's milk mignonette - probably one of the best if not the best migonette I've had. Migonette is my preferred topping on oysters so I've had quite a few variations now and this one is killer! *Iceberg Wedge - avocado, chive cream, puffed wild rice - WOW, not your grandmother's iceberg wedge. I don't even usually like iceberg wedge, but this had such good flavor, textures..perfection. It was also huge - plenty to share with a dining companion. *Aloette Burger - beaufort cheese, onion, lettuce - the beaufort cheese on this was a thing of beauty. It was sliced thicc and square and pan fried (?) on both sides. *Fries - because a burger must have fries and these were damn good french fries! Handcut. Thicker. Freshly fried. delish. no notes. I wish we saved room for the impressive looking desserts, but we were stuffed!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This is a place to eat and drink the night away. Shared the pitmaster platter, a bunch of sides and the smores for dessert. Standouts were the fried chicken (really tasty, juicy inside, not greasy), cornbread (great balance of being moist and chewy) and smores (indulgently hefty). If I had a bone to pick, would have liked the brisket and ribs to be a tad bit more tender. Service was quick and helpful. Space was great for groups. Vibe was lively yet conversation-friendly. This is a good spot to meet up with friends.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"What a gem of a BBQ spot! I've been to quite a few BBQ spots in North America, and this place is high on my list! Vibe: We were seated in the dining area, which was designed really well. It wasn't particularly a loud environment, but I wouldn't say it was intimate either. It's a very large space. It actually wasn't as busy as I was expecting it to be on a Friday night. Food: We opted for the \"experience menu\", which interestingly enough, was pre-chosen. We received the following: Korean Fried Cauliflower- WOW these were absolutely delightful 5\/- I'm not a fan of shishitos, but these were really yummy. The Guajilo Chili was sublime! 5\/- The salmon was incredibly fresh, and the puffed riced scoops were quite a surprise. 5\/- I love a good caesar, and this was just that; Although, it was a little heavy on the sauce, but still delicious. 5\/- The ribs, brisket, sausage, and pulled pork were to die for. There was also chicken and turkey breast which i did not eat. Honestly, at this point, we were quite full (all the other courses were very generously sized) and we ended up taking the rest to go. It was still delicious . 5\/: The smokin' Manhattan- This was rather an average smokey manhattan. Nothing outrageous, but well balanced. 4\/- Now this was my kind of drink. Absolutely delightful. Highly recommend 5\/: The service was great; although our server was rather corky and not the most hospitable, but still very nice. It's evident that the management does a great job of controlling all the staff. Each meal came out with perfect timing and each of the dishes were well explained. 5\/5","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Upscale BBQ at its best! I was very impressed with my recent visit to The Carbon Bar for classic smokehouse BBQ and cocktails! The BBQ lineup is quite extensive with classics such as Beef Brisket,  Sausage and Ribs! The brisket is nice and tender and you do not need a knife to cut through the beef brisket. The fried chicken is nice and crispy with the chicken still remaining its moistness. The cocktail lineup is impressive with many classics that pairs well with bbq! I can't wait for my next visit!","Sentiment":"positive"}

Also the cocktails are all \"designed\" in house - we really enjoyed the whole experience.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"The place is gorgeous, but I have only done take out when in the area to bring home to hubby, because he loves BBQ. We have tried many items but the standouts for us are the Espresso BBQ sauce, racks of ribs, and the Korean Fried Cauliflower.  All delicious! They can get busy, so make sure to allow time for your order. One of these days will drag hubby downtown and dine there in person!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"*Drinks review only* Stopped in at around 5:. It looks like a pretty hip place. Once you walk in, they have sound boards nailed on the wall. We sat by the bar but the rest of the dining area looked pretty spacious. For drinks, I had the Texas Tea (Michter's bourbon, ginger liqueur, eucalyptus apricot and mint honey lemon juice). It was nice and refreshing. There were a few others that sounded pretty good but we had to get to a dinner resso. It's definitely a unique cocktail menu though and I appreciate that they have more than your typical old fashioned and mojitos.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"If it weren't for Summerlicious, I probably would've never visited this restaurant tucked away behind Downtown Camera - but I'm so glad that I ended up here! This is a Texas BBQ joint, a cuisine I haven't really ever explored. To start, the interior is really classy and modern looking, and a lot bigger than it looks on the outside. Their Summerlicious menu consists of . For the appetizer, I chose the caesar salad which came as two big chunks of lettuce that you cut up to make your salad. It sounds weird but I actually enjoyed it! The other options were salmon tartare and a mini birria quesadilla, which my friends both opted for - and they said both were good. For our main, we all chose the same thing: the pit platter, so the kitchen put all of our orders together on a huge platter (as the name suggests). There was enough for everyone to get two ribs, two slices of beef brisket, and more than a spoonful of pulled pork each. They had three \"hot\" sauces that I think are made in-house (?) but none of them were really that hot. As for the meat, the ribs were really tender and fell off the bone. They paired really well with the sweet 'n spicy sauce offered. The brisket was my favourite; the flavour was so good and it paired well with the espresso hot sauce. And finally, I'm not a huge fan of pulled pork, but theirs wasn't too bad. My dessert was the coconut creme pie and the coconut was super overpowering. I wish I had gotten the banoffie pie - it had a great texture and was much more pleasant to eat than the dry coconut. The service was quick and the manager\/owner even stopped by at one point to give us a lil' history lesson on the building and the story of The Carbon Bar. Overall, this was a great visit - and for all the BBQ lovers out there, this is the spot for you!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"The Texas BBQ will have you feeling full for days. I'm still full as I write this review. The meat is BBQ'd to perfection. Juicy, packed with flavour, absolutely delectable. As full and lethargic as it might have made me feel post meal, I'm still craving the leftovers. The cocktails, the selection of bourbon, and the sides all compliment the platter really well. We took the burden of decisions off our hands and selected \"the experience\", which is a curated meal. A couple of starters, a seafood item, salad, then the platter (which you can get on its own), and dessert for the finish. The pie, which I wish I could remember the name of, was decadent and I could eat a whole bowl of that. Even after eating all that heavy heavy meat. So, go hear hungry and don't plan to go out dancing afterwards. I'd recommend you find a plush chair with a cigar to let your gut do it's job. Our server was nice, helpful, and an all round great person. Our food was a tad disjointed in its arrival as there was a long pause after our starters, but it didn't ruin anything. We had more time to chat and drink. I must mention one thing though... The place is very loud. I had a hard time hearing people across the table and felt like I had to yell. So, not your spot for an intimate dinner.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I ordered Ahi Tuna Tartar for appetizer, Woodfire Grilled Australian Rack of Lamb for entr\u00e9e and Blue Chocolate Cake for dessert. And I enjoyed all.

{"Review Text":"If you're looking for an upscale restaurant in Yorkville with attentive service, Blu might for the bill. However I wouldn't recommend it for the food or drinks and feel surprised by the . We came in a group of six to celebrate a birthday and sat in their outdoor patio. Please note they don't split bills for a party of six or above and an 18% gratuity is automatically applied. Food is pricey and portions are moderate. The lamb was mediocre and the accompanying risotto was the best part of that dish. The salmon was very basic and under seasoned, sides were also underwhelming. The best dish that evening was the chicken and it was also pretty basic. For dessert we ordered a chocolate cake and tiramisu. The chocolate cake was better than tiramisu. Cocktails were pricey at $'t even take more than two sips of my margarita. It wasn't good at all. A bit disappointing for an upscale restaurant in Yorkville. If location and vibe is what your after, it may be worth checking out. However if you're looking for good food, you're better served looking for an alternative.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Had an experience that definitely left a bad impression. I'll explain towards the end since it happened at the end of the meal. The initial reservation process was easy, and we were able to get an early dinner table for New years Eve. There was a prefixe menu available for the night - no gratuity specified. Service was alright, felt a little rush\/quick. They kept clearing things from the table right away and setting down courses before we were done with the last. I thought they were just being really attentive but thinking back, they just wanted turnover. The food was alright. The initial course you can choose cheese or deli meats. I find it a bit odd that they don't offer a small mix of both. I literally received . The appetizer was great. I had the carpaccio while my bf enjoyed their Bosco pear salad with beets. We ordered non alcoholic drinks as well which were super disappointing. I got pear nectar soda and he got peach. They tasted nothing like the fruits. It was essentially soda water, but I really just didn't want to bother.  At $, I would recommend you take a pass. Just order wine My bf got the beef tenderloin which he thoroughly enjoyed and I ordered the branzino. I enjoyed the flavor but I was disappointed with the skin on the fish. It was super soggy which created a bad mouth feel. Otherwise the dish was good. I wouldn't order it again though. Dessert was alright. I'm not a dessert person so my bf enjoyed it all. There was an orange Panna cotta, tiramisu slice, poached pear and cannoli. The cannoli was really soggy. I think they pre filled these a while before serving. Disappointing for a restaurant of this style and caliber. Now here is why I took this from a .  When paying our bill, the server didn't give us our space to do the gratuity. He actually watched my bf type the percentage. It was generous but I guess he didn't feel it was generous enough because he TOOK THE MACHINE FROM MY BOYFRIEND AND SAID \"here, I'll do it for you\". He then entered a higher percentage and then told us it's new years Eve. Now, I'm not here to start the to tipping culture conversation. But tips are optional and up to the guest to decide. At no point is it up to the server to take the machine and enter what they want. It was incredibly rude and my bf had no idea how to react to that. So the server takes the machine, enters his own gratuity, and has the audacity to tell us it's standard for the night. You bet I talked to the host and FOH manager right after. I've worked hospitality for years. Gratuity can be set for group reservations or sometimes events, but it was not at all the case this night. The host and managers got the servers name from us and they apologized. The manager was very kind to gift us a certificate and welcomed us to return again another night. I hope they realize they need to keep a closer eye on what the heck their servers are doing upstairs. They seem to be running some sketchy show up there. That server reflects poorly on his team. I wouldn't want that guy serving my guests. If you get a server and they ever dare to tell you how much to tip them, you say no. It's not ok. They are never to take that machine from you to enter their own number. They don't get to do that. It's incredibly rude and unethical. We're unsure if we'd want to return. Maybe we'll sit at the bar next time and just munch down on some apps. Their appetizer menu is quite nice.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Trattoria Nervosa in Yorkville is a culinary gem. We waited , and it was well worth it. The charming ambiance and attentive staff set the stage for an exceptional dining experience. We ordered the kale salad (insalata di cavolo nero), mushroom pasta (mafalde ai funghi), eggplant pasta (norma), bolognese, and another pasta. Our favourite pasta was undoubtedly the mushroom pasta - impeccably cooked, rich in flavour, and true to authentic Italian roots. The kale salad was ok, and we could have done without it. The menu boasts an impressive selection of dishes that cater to diverse tastes. Paired with an extensive alcohol menu, it's a haven for food and drink enthusiasts.

{"Review Text":"We checked out Trattoria Nervosa in Yorkville, I was expecting nasty expensive prices but surprisingly it was pretty on par with places like Gusto Here's the verdict: Mafalde Al Funghi - I actually think this has the right amount of creaminess, I think Gusto's can be a bit too creamy. So this hits good in terms of creaminess, however, it could definitely be more tastier. There also wasn't enough mushrooms compared to Gusto. All in all, pretty decent Mushroom pasta & I would def have it again - lowkey a comfort food of mine Rigatoni Bolognese - huge portions, the usual expectation you can have for a bolognese dish, could have more sauce tho! Tiramisu - again, another huge plate! I'm loving the portions here, & you can actually taste the coffee taste They plenty of patio seating, we ended up in the rooftop, unfortunately the views were blocked by curtains as it was chilly that night. Def check it out at night when the lights are on, it's giving romance Food: 8\/: 8\/: 8.5\/10","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"A few friends have told me that Nervosa is the best Italian in town, and I've been wanting to try it forever but they don't take reservations so you have to time things right. Turns out, Nervosa lives up to the hype. But what I didn't know is that they're owned by the same group as Gusto , so some of the dishes are the same, and the food is fantastic. We started with the margherita pizza, and it was everything you want in a great pizza - the perfectly charred crust, nice chew on the dough, and the sauce hit just right with the perfect amount of tang and sweetness. After that we got their classic truffle mushroom pasta and rigatoni bolognese which were both delicious. They also had some great bottles of lambrusco (sparkling red wine) which helped craft the perfect summer vibe on their patio.

Both delicious and fresh! I was full, without feeling that draining carb overload. The service was fantastic and, surprisingly, it wasn't too busy when we went on a Friday night.

{"Review Text":"Was surprisingly busy for a Thursday night, my friend and I waited for  *6* minutes to get there (we were given ), our table was given to someone else. Once we finally got a table, we got some food (as one does). I got the Mediterranean Pizza, which was fine and not very flavourful. I feel like I could have gotten something similar from Pi Co for less $. We also tried the Risotto Nervosa, which was small in size and quite unremarkable. I'm not a chef by any means, but I've cooked Mushroom Risotto that tasted similar. For dessert we got Tiramisu, which was pretty good. It was just sweet enough and I enjoyed the creamy part on top. We sat upstairs which was a bit crowded, but cozy. It is inevitable to have someone bump into you at least once while sitting. Overall, not a bad place for some Italian fare, but you will have to wait 30+ minutes to get a table and likely drop $40+ for a decent meal.","Sentiment":"positive"}

They mention in the menu that the homefries are with their \"legendary sauce\", highkey just tastes like ketchup. Instead of a side of pancakes or waffles as with other diners its a pathetic piece of rye bread cut in half. Service was slow overall, took them a while to get us cutlery and water set up. They do have a student discount of 20% so make sure you show student ID if eligible, which makes the price a bit better. Just meh, and busy. Probably not coming back.","Sentiment":"positive"}

One of the big pulls to the restaurant was that it has a lot of gluten free options! I had the eggs Benedict with salmon named charlotte on the menu. It came with a side of mixed salad and potatoes. Overall it was ok - nothing spectacular. The salmon and Benny sauce were both bland. The potatoes were covered in ketchup which was not something that not everyone could enjoy as well. My husband had an omelette which was once again underwhelming. I left feeling surprised that this restaurant actually made it to a recommended brunch spot list actually because it is not somewhere that I could see myself wanting to go again.

{"Review Text":"I think it's a great spot. If you're in the financial district, we had a lot of fun only went there for happy hour. There are happy hour drinks, and food from 2-5PM on weekdays. Drinks range from the $ $, and includes at variety of cocktails, beer, and wine There's lots of seating available, and it is right along the first Canadian place building, as well as in the PATH, so it is quite easy to meet up with individuals after work. Will definitely come back again during happy hour time. Otherwise, I think that the food at south is pretty lacklustre and we're not pay the usual price . The service is also a bit slow so I would recommend ordering multiple drinks if you don't have that much time and you're done work around .","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Before you even enter this restaurant you can tell it's going to be loud. It's also incredibly crowded, so between the music blasting and everyone else yelling to be heard over the noise it's very difficult to have a conversation. To our surprise, the appetizers arrived quickly and were quite tasty. We ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp and Brussels Sprouts and really enjoyed both. For my entree I ordered the Creole Chicken and it was really good, but a bit saltier than I would have liked. The mashed potatoes were good but I wished there was more broccolini. My partner got the Steak Frites, and it was pretty good but not the best steak we've ever had. For dessert we ordered the Warm Pretzel Crunch Brownie and New York Cheesecake. Both were delicious and actually had a larger portion than I typically expect for dessert. It was a great way to end the meal and we were both quite happy with it. Overall the food here was great and the service was really good too. I really wish it wasn't quite so loud but other than that we had a pleasant experience.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"This is a great choice for corporate events or big group functions. There are lots of available seating present inside. I have personal experience wherein the company I am with all had good feedback on this venue being chosen. Menu options and food preparation are all top notch and very classy. They have a wide variety of fun and delectable appetizers available to choose from. On the negative side, several from my party ordered the steak and it ranged from being a little too salty or a little dry. Our particular dining spot also was a little on the hot side. We let the waitress know at least a couple of times about it, and they said they will take care of it. Unfortunately, the night went on and there seemed to be nothing done about the heating situation.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"The buzz is this place has awesome pizza but went for brunch! Solid spot. Had their version of a Huevos rancheros. I'll admit I've had better but their version has a spin where the ly use a soft tortilla bread under the eggs. I liked the flavour - it just could have had more something. My friend had the eggs Benny and she claimed to be very happy. Finishing every single morsel on her plate. The customer service was stellar. Really made you feel comfortable and not rushed. Positive experience from entering to exit so definitely am happy to return and try the pizza","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"In classic fashion, the space is pretty tight and generally a little difficult to navigate. Still, we were lucky to pop in and grab the last two counter seats right before a wave came in which had to wait. The service is not bad, but not particularly courteous, but this is really just about the food. One thing they emphasize is self-ground sesame seeds -- seeds provided in a little bowl with a grinder for your ramen depending on which dish you get (a little participation). In terms of price, not the most expensive ramen, but I wouldn't say cheap -- fairly priced is probably the best phrase. White Sesame Shio - The broth for this dish was amazing. Right away, I was delighted by the bold flavor and seasoning. Everything went perfectly well together. The pork was delicious as well, quite tender and flavorful. Highly recommend this dish. I left very satisfied with my meal. Value: 3\/: 5\/: 5\/: 3\/: 3\/5","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I was recommended this place by a local. You know the place is good when it is small and there is a wait. One downfall to start is that there is no WIFI available. It is not mando to have it, but it is a downfall. I was visiting from California so it makes it difficult to park on the streets without having internet or wifi connection. Not the restaurants problem, but I asked for help or a solution to parking and no one was able to assist. The menu looks straight forward, but there were too many options. , , . That's alot of options!  This is by far the most expensive ramen I have ever paid for. And I live in the bay area where things are jacked up expensive. Luckily the exchange rate was good when I went and the conversion wasn't so bad. With , we all got different bowls - Red dragon, spicy red miso, roasted garlic shoyu and the shoyu tsukemen. They all were good in their own ways. One downfall to this place is that the bowls don't come with much. You literally have to add extra toppings that range from $1-$8.. The menu has pictures but doesn't actually tell you what's in every bowl. Service was great which is pretty rare for an asian establishment! Our server was very sweet and took his time telling us what was included in each of the individual bowls. And yooooo, they serve you hella noodles. The asian in me did not want to waste food, but boy oh boy.... This ramen won.. We also came close to closing so maybe they were just pushing out what they had left. Regardless, it was appreciated!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"When my friend, a local Torontian, highly recommended Ramen Isshin, you can be sure Hubby and I were definitely going to take their advice and we are so glad we did. The food, service, and the atmosphere were top-notch as Isshin Ramen is a great place to get a delicious and authentic ramen experience. We started off with a shared plate of Hiya Yakko, which is cold tofu smothered with their secret freshly made chili oil, with green onions and bamboo shoots delicately layered on top. It was a refreshing and flavorful start to the meal. For our main entrees, I ordered the Isshin Red Miso ramen which set the food mood as it had a wonderful aroma. The thick and wavy noodles were perfect as the ground tofu and wood ear mushrooms were able to intermingle with the noodle's waves nicely. The depth and dimensions were outstanding. My Hubby had the Vegetarian Roasted Garlic Shoyu which my Hubby declared was delicious, with two varieties of mushrooms: shiitake and button. Both our noodles had the perfect bounce and the soups were rich, we quaffed all of it. We concluded our meal with Kakigori Hochi Cha. Our shaved ice was very different from the Korean Bingsu we were accustomed to, as we found this to be more refreshing. The Japanese Kakigori is ice based and made from water. The ice had been grounded down to flakes and then the sweet milky Hochi cha was adorned on top of the ice flakes. Beyond sublime! It was a seasonal special so always ask what their seasonal desserts are and save room for them. My only suggestion is for the servers to take away the trays, as the tables are a bit tight. This is a minor suggestion, but didn't detract from my overall experience. Service: 5\/: 5\/: 5\/: 5\/5","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Delicious and authentic ramen!! I haven't had good tsukemen since visiting LA and Tokyo and was so excited to try it at ramen Isshin, which exceeded my expectations. The broth was hot, flavorful, and strong in seafood flavor. Noodles were perfect thickness and chewiness. It was so satsifying! As for the service, waitress was kind but had limited English, probably much easier if you know Japanese if you have questions. Otherwise if you just state your order it's a breeze. We arrived about . Actually I think there was some miscommunication...they told us it was going to take a long time to get seated until I asked if we could sit at the counter where there was plenty of space. I think they usually just seat single diners there? Karaage was also very good. Crispy and big pieces. Couldn't speak for the red miso ramen but my husband seemed to enjoy it. Casual ambiance with an open kitchen. Will def return someday.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I should've reviewed this Ramen Isshin last year  Am I dreaming? Or maybe it is because their ramen is astonishing and made me dream in the air! If you like Japanese culture or just like ramen, you'll like this restaurant at the first sight of it. It has an exotic japanese-style decoration and the waiters always shout out some Japanese words to show their hospitality. That makes you feel you're really in a ramen restaurant in Japan. Their ramen is very tasty, yet it isn't too strong or savoury to appal non-Japansese people. They also provide vegetarian ramen so you can still enjoy their culinary skill if you're a vegetarian. \"Isshin\" is the Japanese which means to focus on perfecting something. I think Ramen Isshin is qualified for owning that name. There's one instresting thing: I went to the restaurant twice and without any idea, I ordered the same ramen for the both times. I must try something different next time!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Their dipping ramen was the best ramen I've ever had, hands down. Very busy but well worth it in my opinion!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Started with Sapporo on draft.  Nice to have a cold one at the end of the day.  I had tako taki which I haven't had before.  They were octopus formed into balls and deep fried.  Quite tasty.  My main entree was Red Dragon ramen but I wanted it mild.  They put the spicy items in the side.  I also ordered extra noodles.  If I was to have a complaint it would be that the chasu was on the thin side.  I haven't had it this thin before.  The extra noodles gave me plenty to eat.  I would of liked it to have more ingredients.  I left quite filled though.  Service was fine.  The place was relatively small and busy.  The restrooms were clean.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Isshin is a good place to enjoy not only ramen but also different kind of side dishes. The broth has rich flavor and the texture of ramen is chewy. They have open kitchen that you could enjoy and watch chef cooking your ramen while waiting for the meal. All Staffs are nice and kind, you could customize you ramen for adding more ingredients or spices. Highly recommended","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This authentic Italian gem offers a sublime dining experience. The attentive service ensures a seamless evening, with staff well-versed in guiding through the menu.

{"Review Text":"You're in for a treat when you visit Buca. Always an exceptional experience, from the service to the innovative Italian food. One of the top Italian spots in the city. We ordered a round of cocktails, and I ordered something a bit more adventurous, the pork blood pasta. I'm usually not a fan of pork blood in foods, but I enjoyed my pasta here. You won't even notice there is pork blood in it at all. It just melds together well with that comforting, fresh pasta. The portion size for my dish left me satisfied, not stuffed. Where else would you find pork blood pasta?! You have to try it for yourself. They rotate their menu from time to time, but I see they still have the pork blood pasta on their menu now. I love the romantic vibe as you walk through an alley full of string lights to the entrance. Our server is knowledgeable about each dish--a perfect spot for a special occasion like entertaining clients, friends or for a date night.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Came to this restaurant for the first time with good expectations. This has been one of the worst service experience I've had in a restaurant. Service was very slow and waiter hardly checked in. Had to wait over  (restaurant wasn't even busy). Food was pretty average. Would not recommend.","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Great location, great quality food, DELICIOUS! Hidden away off the busy King street into a lit alleyway is where you will find Buca. The staff were very friendly, patient and so knowledgeable about all their food options they provide. The best part is that they handle all their meats in house and use every part of an animal in their dishes. Drinks were refreshing and recommended by our server based on our preferences. Definitely let your server know what your palette enjoys and they will be sure to find something that you like. Food. Let's get started with food. The Nodini - warm bread knots with olive oil, rosemary and garlic were great to share amongst the table. Perfectly sized . Harder shell on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Spaghetti Al Nero Di Maiale - this is a port blood pasta, 'nduja di buca, wild leek, stracciatella. Don't get intimidated by this dish as it does not taste iron-y at all. A nice change to your regular tomato sauce spaghetti. Get this if you're feeling a little adventurous. Strozzapreti Al Ragu - delicious! Well balanced flavours with tender pieces of ragu. Pasta was perfectly cooked to al dente. A little on the heavier side, a lot of oil at the bottom of my plate once the dish was consumed. But still very delicious! Gnocchi Ripieni - did not personally try this. But the presentation of this dish was beautiful! Perfect for any vegetarians or pescatarians! Finished off with a waffle dessert that was nice, airy and light - hints of lemon. Don't recall the full name of this dessert but it was delicious and the best highlight of the meal!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Service and cocktails were incredible. Tried horse meat for the first time and the waitstaff were all extremely knowledgeable of the menu. The pasta was absolutely incredible but the pizza was cold and mediocre. Amazing espresso martinis!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I'm going to start with - I have NO idea what I ordered but it had Ragu in the title and pasta in the description so I was assuming (at the time) a pasta with sauce of some sort.  I still don't know what I ate. The food was very different, still good, but not being from  (or Italy), I had no idea what to expect or what I was getting.  The sauce was brown, not red, and the dish had a very salty taste to it.  The Cab went very well with it.  Our group ordered a number of appetizers that were all very good. This was a bit of an experience.  I almost felt as though I was in a French restaurant - wine and several courses over about three hours. Service seemed slow, but again, I wasn't sure what to expect.  This is not Americanized Italian food.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"They have definitely kept up their quality throughout the years. Went for a bite on a Saturday afternoon and they were very accommodating finding my sister a bar stool as she was too short to eat at the bar while standing. Every dish was delicious, the hamburgesa (more interesting than it sounds) , the eggplant with honey (like salty sweet fries), the leek and pancetta (our server tried to describe it, just get it) and the pintos with white anchovies and stracciatella was perfectly balanced","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Very ok. A mix of quality with the tapas. Cool atmosphere, was glad we went on a quiet weeknight. Liked the mushroom shrimp tower, jamon croquettes, and eggplant and honey. The octopus wasn't great (flavor or texture). Glad we tried it, but not among my favorite food in the city","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Unique tapas bar with delicious drinks. It is super crowded during the night and it was a bit difficult to get our order through. Heirloom Tomatoes & Tonnato was marked as $. I was wrong. Okay, it is still pretty pricy but we wanted to lick the plate because the dressing\/sauce (?) was that delicious. Jamon Croquetas was also a decent choice. It is a creamy ham croquette with mashed potatoes. This is a tapas bar after all, so don't expect to get full after the dishes. Also ordered several drinks and cocktails including Say Less, Magic City, and See U Never. Every drink was pleasant. See U Never was my personal favorite because I loveee the taste of yuzu and sour flavors in general. Plus, the interior is super cool! It seemed casual yet formal at the same time. We did not really have a designated seat. Instead, about half of the people were probably standing around the big table that's connected to the wall.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We arrived shortly after . Once inside, I felt as if I were in another world. It was before sunset time, but the inside was dark\/dim with unique indirect lighting fixtures. The space was small - it was like a hideout cave in the city :) A server greeted us and said \"wherever you want\" - there are a few high-top tables, window counter areas, and a bar counter area with a limited number of bar stools. Essentially, it is a standing bar. All the bar stools were already taken by earlier visitors. As time passes, many people entered and grab drinks. Some are in groups, some are solo. In spite of the small size of the space and the number of people inside, I did not feel my private space was invaded by others. Maybe because of the way they arrange the lighting? Comfortable. We had Food: (From  CONSERVAS -Canned seafood): Razor Clams (From PINTXOS - small snack) :Stracciatella & Boquerones (From TAPAS - appetizers) : Octopus & Sobrassada Drink: - Cocktail specially made for my girlfriend's preference (gin based, fruity, and fizzy) - See You No More - Raval Martini - Left Field 'Greenwood IPA' - Burdock APA (on tap) - Estrella Damm (Spanish Lager) We loved Stracciatella & Boquerones. A layer of milky, slightly sweet, super melty fresh cheese, silky marinated white anchovy, and a thin slice of crispy bread. Enjoyed all these different textures and flavors. The refreshing parsley sauce on top perfected the dish. Wow to the Octopus & Sobrassada. Octopus pieces are hot and crisp outside but tender inside. The pieces of Sobrassada (Spanish cured sausage) transferred their flavor - saltiness, sourness, and spiciness onto other ingredients, and harmonized the taste of the dish. The paprika in Sobrassada rounded the flavor and gave it an appetizing red color. Yum! We had Razor clams for the first time (we were a bit nervous :) - it was chewy and soft, which was a pleasant surprise! Among all the drinks - my girlfriend and I both agreed that \"See You No More\" was the best.:) Highly recommend. Of course, the prices are higher than other bars. But we were happy about our experiences there!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"One of the top bars in the city, so you're going to expect a wait. Add yourself to their online waitlist as soon as possible. When we looked online, there wasn't much of a waitlist, but as we were about to go 45-30mins in advance, we added ourselves to the digital waitlist and found ourselves in a long line. Perhaps everyone added themselves to the waitlist around the same time. We had to wait nearly an additional hour once we got there on a weekend evening. Their digital waitlist isn't that accurate at all! The atmosphere is lively, great vibes and dimly lit. We were \"seated\" in a section with small high round tables with a sprinkle of stools around that section. There are not enough seats for all the tables. We were lucky and took it upon ourselves to grab stools to sit down when another table emptied next to us. Otherwise, expect to stand and enjoy your drinks and bites. The quality of the food and cocktails are next level. It blew us away, well thought out and refined. Not one dish disappointed. The standout has to be the Mushroom Tower. Price point is about $15~ for cocktails and $15--3. They can also add more single portions so there is never that awkward sharing moment. The cocktails are delicious, and the server will help you pick one that fits your palate.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Hidden gem in Kensington Market. Unassuming from the exterior with a pleasant interior with three seating styles: bar seating, tables and kitchen bar seating. The menu is limited but has a good variety fo choices. We had the  (good but pricey; I would probably try the smoked fish dip next time for a more economical starter). The Celery Root and Scallop dishes were amazing. Pretty plating and a perfect balance of flavours. The Tagliatelle was a bit underwhelming compared to the other dishes; it's decent but nothing special. I would try the Hand Torn Noodles next time.  The Skate on the other hand was amazing - it looked and tasted almost like a brisket and was served in a buttery foam with lots of sauce. Would definitely recommend and would come back again!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I love everything about this place, from the cozy ambiance, to the friendly & knowledgeable servers to the inventive and exciting food. Most appropriate as sharing plates. One teeny negative on Saturday night was the sauce under the (amazing) duck - waaaay too salty, so that it masked the other flavours.   Other than that - brilliant! Don't leave without having their bread. Off the charts.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"What a delight this place is. My friend and I shared four  delicious dishes (plus the devine grilled bread) - from cucumber, pea shoot salad  to lobster tagliatelle and a roasted corn pur\u00e9e ravioli, that is to die for. We then shared a fantastic peach grilled cake dessert with a basil cream underneath and peanut brittle with peach ice cream. The decor has a lovely vintage vibe and sitting at the bar watching all of the cooks at work, was really fun. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that the bathroom lock mechanism was broken & it was dirty, which was somewhat disconcerting!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"If you ever wondered where the upwardly-mobile foodie hipsters dine, this is the place! The food is fantastic, the ambiance is casual, yet elegant, and the service is down to earth. Great meal experience overall. This place gets high accolades (it also appears on the Michelin guide honourable mentions), and it did not disappoint. Food: 5\/5 ======== The food is most delicious. Each dish was well-thought-out. You can tell that they are serious about their food, as they have a big open gallery kitchen that is teaming with activity. Here's what we got: Smoked fish appetizer - $16. Most delicious spread. Very smokey. Was served with super thin potato chips. At first I thought it was weird to have a chip instead of a cracker, but it actually worked beautifully. Must try dish. Kampachi - $22 - delicious crudo. Must try. Celery root salad - $18 - very nice. Cauliflower - $18 - very nice. Skate - $35 - very delicious. Was very rich, like a braised beef. Five Spice Cake - $12. Yum! I LOVE five spice, and the cake did the spice mix justice. One complaint I had was that the cocktail list was basically non-existent. The one cocktail I tried (Bitter Spritz 18$) was not great (diluted, sweet and no bitters). The wine options were very expensive. I opted for the Saison beer (Burdock Tuesday $9), and I was not disappointed. Service: 4\/5 ========= The service was mostly friendly, but a little lukewarm. The server knew the dishes very well, and was able to remember the options by heart. Very casual style of service overall (complete with hipster scruffy outfits), which is somewhat nice, and at the same time leaves you wanting a little more  warmth and elegance. Ambiance: 5\/5 ============ The ambiance overall is very nice. Let's start with the fact that the restaurant is located in hipster-central: Kensington Market. At the same time, it's definitely elevated for the neighbourhood. The place is very casual, but not without elegance. The decor is grungy, but not without style. The lights are nice and dim. It's definitely warm and rather romantic. You could definitely come here on a first date. The playlist was amazing. I kept wanting to Shazam the songs. Value: 3\/5 ======== The small plates are rather expensive. You won't leave here stuffed. At the same time, you feel like you are getting rewarded with great tasting plates. Keep up the good work, Grey Gardens.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We made reservations to Grey Gardens for a table for two a month prior. Between us, we ordered the smoked fish chip and dip, scallop crudo, crown, smoked leeks, apple galette, and panna cotta. They had an extensive wine selection and some non-alcoholic options.

Accessibility: washrooms have an automatic door opener button.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Quaint French restaurant that has a unique rotating menu. Their drinks were a bit lacking in flavor, I got the Citrus Spritz and my boyfriend got an Old Fashioned. The spritz was a bit flat. The star of the night was the ravioli - the potato and cheese filling was utterly delicious. Each bite was a perfect cheesy morsel. My boyfriend got the lamb shoulder (not pictured) that was a bit tough? Normally you'd expect the meat to melt in your mouth more but it was a bit hard to chew, not to mention the flavor was just ok. The best part of the lamb dish were the veggies on top. Service was good, we booked a reservation the week before and were seated promptly. Overall a decent experience.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"went there on a snowy day, we didn't get to make reservations early enough so we got seated at the bar. I have never heard about this place before until my friend told me about it, and we both came with high expectations. what we ordered: 1. Red Tail Bread ~ butter: this , i honest prob could just order , it is so soft, and the butter is so airy too, if cloud has a form and is edible, that must be how it tastes like 2. Cod: it was , and it is a small piece of cod which is flaky, the sauce tho, it was amazing , i have to say i would be much happier if i can have more fish with more of that sauce with that price. but this just makes me hungry by looking at it. 3. Sweet Potato Cake: it is indeed very good as all the other reviews say, i enjoyed it a lot. some areas where I think can be improved: 1. i think the sign needs to change, in the dark there is absolutely no way to tell the name since its grey on grey without any lights. i know it is aesthetic, but it is not friendly to anyone's eyes 2. the bathroom situation is extremely weird, they have a big area downstairs where there are events \/group dinners held, but there are also several bathrooms downstairs, while upstairs there is 1, and where there is any event, eveyrone else upstairs need to wait on the one together and trust me it was not a pleasant line. i had to wait and wait and wait until it was my turn, if your upstairs is already that busy, and there is no way to open another bathroom, why even use the downstairs as a private event place?","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Good for a date night, as long as you're not stuck at the bar. Fortunately, we were sitting indoors, but if you're in the patio, the preferred seat is facing the restaurant, as long as you don't mind looking into the park of homelessness across the street. I'm sure you won't be harassed for pocket change as the restaurant has been there long enough for the vagrants to be respectful. I would recommend that your server write down your order if you have more than 3-. We were offered a complimentary dessert for a forgotten dish and a overly savoury dish. Good gesture. If I was with a boring date, I would have had to spend another 30-. However, with the right date, this is more time with your sweetheart. Overall, food satisfaction is just a touch above average, but the table seating inside makes up for quite a bite. Somewhat attentive staff, but I do find a little repulsive the reuse of the same damp table rag for wiping down table surfaces for all tables for as long as we were there. One would think a rinse after each use would be warranted. Oh, if you have a bladder problem, be warned, the wait for the single washroom could be annoying. Good excuse to disappear for a while should you expect the check to arrive","Sentiment":"positive"}

Lots of sports on the tv screens dotted about. They have a great selection of Belgium beers including Delirium on tap. Ended up having their burger which was wonderful. lots of frites on the side too. Right near the corner of Yonge and King. easy access to TTC.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Had dinner here with a friend. Seriously --- was difficult to pick something from the menu -- soooo many great choices. Lots of great appetizers too if you prefer drinks and appetizers to a traditional meal. My friend had the mussels (which come in  - she went for the East Coast one).  Comes with a nice mini Sourdough roll.  I had the Schnitzel which was great.  It comes with potato salad and frites (which is a little too much potato for me -- so I switched up the frites for their house salad which was great). Fantastic selection of beers, but also a decent and reasonable wine list. There was no sparkling wine by the glass (we were celebrating her engagement!) - but we just went for the bottle! It has some lively vibe and obviously a popular spot (all tables were taken for the full 2-1\/). There is even a cool spot for singles to sit along an eating bar that faces into the kitchen.  Tres cool. I am thinking next time I will have to try those mussels, although I saw lots of good offerings go by (nice looking burger and pulled pork sandwich as well as a Cheese Fondue - which is not something you typically see!). Check it out -- and hope you enjoy! Service was great too -- helpful, not hovering, and very friendly!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Made reservations for lunch for four and was given a choice of dining inside or outside when we got to the restaurant. It was about half filled for weekday lunch service. There are two rows of patio seats outside which was a slight obstacle course to walk through. The umbrella base is this huge square block placed in the aisle so you have to walk over each one. We were seated and left alone with nothing. No menus or water for quite a bit of time. Finally, our server came and served us water. The menu was simple for lunch, several choices in handheld items but not many others besides mussels and one steak. Coworkers ordered tacos and they did not come with any sides so we also ordered the Belgian Frites. The tacos looked kind of small, the order came with four wonton sized pieces. The description on the menu for the Belgian Frites sounded amazing. \"Blanched in beef tallow & duck fat\" accompanied by two house made sauces. Unfortunately, the frites fell flat. The frites itself was not evenly fried, most of the pieces were soft. The sauces were bland and almost flavourless. I ordered the Steak Sandwich and it was okay. The striploin was done right, medium rare as requested. The bistro salad was overdressed, it was drenched in sauce. Overall, would not be back again.

The have an extensive beer list and I chose the Great Lakes Brewing Octopus Wants to Fight IPA.  The food was just OK, probably not anything I would have again.  One of the highlights was our server trainee Destiny, who was working her first shift ever at Beerbistro and cheerfully admitted that she new very little about the menu, but going off to find the answers to our questions.  She should do well in the future. A nice place to stop in and have a drink, but you might want to eat elsewhere.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Came here after work with a friend around 6pm. Surprisingly full on a weekday so we were seated by the bar table. They have a very extensive set of beers on tap to choose from and the bartender is rather helpful in determining which one you might like, even giving you a small cup to sample before ordering. I kinda wish more places would do this since committing to a full pint of a beer you've never tried is always a little risky. Started with Henry's Irish Ale ($10) and it was pretty nice. It's a brown ale which was new to me. Definitely a lighter ale, not very bitter. Then tried the Stiegl Gold Lager ($9.75) which was probably my preferred out of the 2. Very easy to drink as with most lagers and made for a nice contrast to the comparatively stronger ale. For food, I went with the bistro mac and cheese ($23) which overall was nice, but a bit small. Plenty of chicken, cheese and breadcrumbs to go around, filling but simply because its a pretty \"heavy\" dish. Would've liked a bit less cheese with a bit more everything else. Decent spot but plenty of options around to try with similar offerings.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Service here was amazing! We happen to come by on a live music night, so that was a nice treat! It wasn't too busy so we sat comfortably across the open kitchen. I love seeing the kitchen and food prep! The food was okay. I wasn't a huge fan of the dishes we ordered. Mostly I was craving mussels. All the food was honestly a bit bland. Needed some more flavors and salt. I liked the mac and cheese and we actually got their fries to go. They make these amazing, French fries that are really rich and delicious. Definitely would recommend. Portion sizing here was very good. Definitely more than I could finish. It's a good place but I think there's tons of better options and value downtown for me to want to come back.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Service was super friendly, we sat outside where it was clean and quiet. I heard the mussels were really good but didn't try them myself. We had poutine at the table which I thought was ok. I had a chicken sandwich with like a jalape\u00f1o coleslaw (I know I'm butchering what it really is). I guess I was expecting a bit more of kick from that but if it wasn't stated on the menu I wouldn't have know. I would come back but probably try something else next time.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Been meaning to try Beer Bistro out, and finally did. Have to say my reaction was a pleasant surprise.  Because I viewed it as a bar, so I was expecting lots of greasy bar-like food.  So, the menu brought a smile to my face as I read through the dishes available.  Seriously, seabass?! Wow.  But I decided on veal as I haven't had it in so long. So, first, I ordered the mussels.  It came in : Belgian white, thai, and Spanish.  I opted for thai as I wanted something really tasty.  It did not disappoint.  Most of all, the portion was generous, which surprised me and made me think that I was in the USA for a moment. The veal chop that I mentioned before was also a huge portion with gnocchi and peppers.  The server didn't ask how I liked it cooked, so I thought perhaps there's no choices when it comes to cooking veal lol.  When it came to me, I thought it looked an bit well done, but as I tasted it, I was surprised at how it was juicy.  My friend said the same for the ribs. For dessert, I tried the blueberry bread pudding with ice-cream.  The ice-cream had a rough texture and it was very mild in taste.  The bread pudding was only ok.  I thought it would taste better with a drizzle of condensed milk. Overall, it was a surprisingly pleasant experience.   Definitely will go back for more bites!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Oh Miku. I was looking forward to coming here to celebrate! And I was not disappointed. For appetizer, we ordered the wagyu carpaccio. This was presented beautifully. The wagyu was placed on top of a pickled veggie and decorated delicately with flower petals on each piece. The star of the show was definitely the salmon oshi. We also ordered the Miku roll, salmon sashimi, o-toro and unagi nigiri. All of these tasted so fresh! No fishy after taste at all. The green tea opera and matcha latte were delicious (and importantly not too sweet). They also decorated the ice cream beautifully as well. Our server came by to check in with us and refill our drinks frequently. Service was efficient and friendly. Excited to visit again!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"As one of my favourite sushi spots in town, I chose Miku for my birthday celebration this year, and it was a truly delightful experience. Starting with the Sashimi Select, the pieces were fresh and beautifully presented on a wooden tray alongside three delightful side dishes - maple glazed salmon, marinated seaweed, and pickled ginger. The glazed salmon, in particular, stood out for its rich and flavorful taste. The Miku Select and Salmon Oshi Sushi were just as delectable as I remembered.  The aburi pieces, though slightly on the oily side, gained a tasty char after being torched. The Green Tea Opera was a symphony of flavours.  The green tea cake base layered with dark chocolate ganache and matcha cream, accompanied by green tea wafers, matcha ice cream, and an assortment of strawberries and blueberries - a truly enriching experience. The added chocolate tag for my birthday was a delightful bonus. Our main server was great - knowledgeable and attentive. But the girl who brought us our dishes seemed a bit irritated, as if she'd rather not be on duty. Nevertheless, it didn't overshadow the overall delightful dining experience.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Their sushi were so good! No soybean sauce or wasabi needed, as they have already been flavored, and they were flavored so well that it didn't cover the taste of fish. The rice was not sticky yet can still melt within your mouth. It was amazing how they were being made this way. Also I like the shape and toppings, which better emphasized the sushi's earthy intensity. Really a great place to have an elegant sushi meal.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"For the love of Aburi sushi! And make it oishi! Best pressed sushi are made here: and torched style with truffle oil for extra. So good!! Absolutely divine. The good: Aburi style sushi! Any of the torches pressed sushi: oishi! The signature rolls, the creamy udon. I wasn't expecting much from Udon but it was worth a trip or 7. The torched pressed sushi though: worth like 10-. Tried their surf and turf roll as well. I thought that was a ok. On a pricier side and a ok. Aburi sushi though, can't go wrong. They are also extremely busy. Make reservation! I got in easy first time around the last trip: I ended up waiting almost an hour for counter: bar seat for 1! Very long wait. Love the green tea opera cake! Get the mini version if you can, compliments the meal, ambiance and then some!! It's a necessary ending for the meal here! Till next time.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"The Valentines Kaiseki was phenomenal, was able to try things I've been meaning to try like Foie Gras, Wagyu, King Crab and Uni! It was fairly pricey for a really long service so... not sure if I'll be coming back but the experience was worth the try! I didn't enjoy it as much as we were seated right beside where the servers pass regularly to go into the kitchen, the ambiance killed it for me as well as how long it took to get each course when others were getting it right away. Our bill came up to $. Imo, if I'm paying that much, the service and ambiance should be to the T. I appreciate those things in a restaurant almost as equally as the food. I've had better experiences in places that are 1\/4th of the price. I'm sure we got unlucky with the seating and given its Valentines Day and all... which was a bummer for us.","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Wonderful from start to finish. We started with their Brussels sprouts which had pieces of pork belly on top that was a nice addition however the Brussels sprouts on their own were wonderful. We ordered a few of their roles however their signature roles are the way to go, and the albacore was absolutely great. We ended with the cheese tart which I was skeptical of (not a fan of grapes and it had blue cheese shavings on it), but not only was it absolutely beautiful the taste was beyond wonderful. If I could have licked the plate I would have. That dessert alone is reason to stop by. Service was flawless and this will definitely be a stop I make when I'm back in this city.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Dishes: Would recommend to try the cold bortch soup (comes with potatoes, quite filling) I also enjoyed their cabbage wraps, but maybe if it's your first time get the Platter for one. It's got a great spread of all their specialties and a very large portion. For dessert I enjoyed their apple pie. Verdict: Would go back :D","Sentiment":"positive"}

The portions are all very big, even though some may feel the portions look \"decent\"--it's actually too much for one person. We got the daily soup (cauliflower soup), the platter for 2, schnitzel platter, and the schnitzel sandwich. For a party of 5, we definitely over ordered. The single-items were still a bit too much for one person. The platter for , we split between . Cauliflower soup was a bit whatever, tasted like chicken noodle, but replace chicken with cauliflower. Still tasty though! A nice appetizer. The schnitzels were wonderful and not tough at all, super tender. My favorite is the cabbage rolls, the filling is to die for (they actually have the filling as a side \"sauce\" lol). The platter came with your choice\/mix of potato + cheese or sauerkraut, both were good but not particularly stand-out items in the platter. All the salads, on the other hand, were perfection!

{"Review Text":"Caf\u00e9 Polonez is a staple family run, Polish restaurant that's been around since 1981. They're a few doors from Ed's Real Scoop. We dropped in on a Friday evening (with 7:00pm reservations). The inside was busy but didn't feel squished as tables are well spaced out. The sidewalk seating (shaded with umbrellas) was packed. Our server was friendly but we weren't checked on once it got lively. The menu is two pages but with a plethora of options; starters, salads, soups, sandwiches, Polish classics, Polonez signatures, schnitzels, combo plates and desserts. - Chlodnik ($8.95) - came with a side of potatoes; cold and bland. I had a taste and the cold borscht was fantastic. Our Polish friend said it reminded him of his grandma's cooking. - Flaczki ($7.95) - first time trying this and it was so satisfying. Tripe was incredibly tender and the broth was pure bliss. Came with a pile of rye bread. - Platter for 1 ($24.95) - the boiled pierogis were heavenly with a great bite. The bigos was super flavourful with sauerkraut, sausage, pork and mushrooms. Schnitzel was a generous portion topped with mushrooms. Nicely breaded and pounded thin. The beet and cabbage helped to balance things off. - Cabbage roll ($4.95) - we opted for the pork. Decent but standard fare. - Pulpety ($20.95) - the , tender and the sauce really dilly. Plate came with potatoes, carrots, beets and cabbage. You can easily share this plate between a couple. I'd come back to CP in a heartbeat.

{"Review Text":"More of a 4.5, but -ons. We were here as a party of four following a nice hike with friends around Bloor West Village and High Park. This was late summer in , for what it's worth, I can at least say that I would definitely come back next time I'm down in the Roncy neighbourhood. I can see that prices have definitely increased, which wouldn't have been a surprise even without COVID and the resulting havoc it wreaked on staffing. My husband and I both ordered a pork schnitzel plate, with potatoes and salad. The schnitzels were very well cooked and not greasy. The potatoes and salad were fresh and well prepared. Another of our party had the roast chicken plate and reported she was very happy with the taste, texture and temperature of her chicken, as we were with the potatoes and salad as well. These dishes did not come with any extras the way some other specials do, so no gravy or sour cream unless you add it on at menu cost. Our other friend went for a vegetarian option and an order of potato pancakes (which in this case did include sour cream, but nothing else.) The restaurant has a wonderful, warm atmosphere with proper wooden tables and chairs, lovely, large front window for light, yet cozy with no glaring light inside. The setup is nice and not bunched up, so going to the bathrooms (which were clean and tidy) didn't require bumping around other diners along the way. The wait staff provided attentive service without being cloying. All those things beside the food which make the difference between being a forgotten meal, and a memory that brings you back.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"The table-side prepared Caesar salad ($) was still a hit with enough dressing to adequately cover the lettuce without being saturated. A mouthful of garlicky umami, the splash of Tabasco  was perhaps a bit more heavy-handed this visit so there was a noticeable kick to the salad. The bacon was still served in chunks, a bit too hard for me. I wish they'd change this to strips so it's crunchier... they could even place a strip on top (like the sliver of anchovy) as a garnish. Making the croutons from leftover cheese buns, rather than regular bread, could bring the salad to new heights. Thankfully, no low-carb vegan diet has influenced Jacobs, their cheese buns still make an appearance. One of the highlights of the meal, it's really a Yorkshire pudding with cheese, slather on butter and these are perfection. Remembering how tasty the T-bone steak looked previously, we substituted our typical rib eye order with their Guelph prime Hereford bone-in T-bone ($175), a hefty 25oz (when including the bone) and was more than enough to share amongst two. While not as marbled as my beloved ribeye, it's a great cut for contrast as you receive a piece of tenderloin and striploin. Both are leaner cuts: the striploin full-flavoured and tenderloin swoon-worthy as it's soft and juicy. The steak's crust was flawless and the seasoning perfectly. For those who find it needs more salt, complimentary condiments - a bacon blue cheese spread, shoyu, chimichurri, and selection of salts - are available. Amongst our table of ten, we shared five side dishes, and it was more than enough. Go to Gastro World for the details of the .","Sentiment":"positive"}

I'm always surprised that so many people have this type of money to spend on dinner, but it was busy so there is no shortage of clientele. My friend and I decided to treat ourselves as moderately as possible here.  The waiter likely sensed this and was very helpful in keeping us within a somewhat high but reasonable budget for this steakhouse.  Service was nothing less than polite and perfect. Surprisingly, a lot of the menu is shareable.  The tableside caesar salad could be split as could most of the sides.  We splurged a bit and got two different steaks.  We left feeling fuller than I was expecting and happy with our experience. I don't have the type of disposable income to make this my new Friday spot.

{"Review Text":"Easily the best steakhouse I've ever been to, and the steak isn't even the best part for me. Excellence perspires through every plate that comes out of that kitchen, and the attention to detail is immaculate. They start you off with their warm bread and butter. The bread is fluffy and crusty all at once, with a lovely herby butter that is dangerously good. Some of the best bread and butter I've ever had, and you're off to a good start. The apps are great across the board, but there's nothing better than the caesar salad. It is bar none, the best salad I have ever had in my life, perfectly dressed and with a mouth-watering combination of textures and flavours in every bite. The seafood is also very good, I especially enjoy their oysters and jumbo shrimp, which are absolutely massive. At this point it's hard not to be full, but the meat is the main event. I recommend getting one of the bigger lower grade steaks to fill up on, with an Aussie wagyu and a Japanese wagyu to taste. The Japanese wagyu is like eating butter, it just melts on your tongue. The Aussie wagyu is my favourite - slightly less fatty but with immense character in the flavours. As for the rest of the steaks, they're all solid, but one bite of the wagyu and it's hard to go back to the regular stuff. When it comes to dessert, everything is solid but not mind blowing. They send you home with a chocolate chip muffin which I usually like to save for breakfast, and it's easily the best muffin I've had in my life. Overall, this place is definitely worth it - it is easily one of the best steakhouses \/ meals I've had in my life, and consistently blows me away every time I try it.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"My post-pandemic birthday celebration was top notch. When you approach the building, it's a bit hidden. Behind these taller than lifesize double doors, you descend down a flight of steps. Your eyes squint in the dimly lit entrance as you're asked about your reservations, valet, and coat check by a line of ladies. Once checked in, you're led through the  (chill and for groups), up a stairs to another busy (family\/groups) section including a bar (single seats), and then finally to the romantic () section. Along the way to the romantic zone, you walk by this giant fridge full of these impressive cuts of meat. All I remember was that they were meaty and juicy, and humungous. Server then comes with menus and introduces the steak menu, and the fact that you can order half portions of the sides. We had a look at the menu beforehand so had a rough idea of narrowing down our choice of steak. The steak menu is vast with steaks ranging from $ $1,000. But if you think that was impressive enough, you haven't looked at the wine menu. Hundreds and hundreds of different wines. We ordered a shareable steak, the Caesar salad (which is a fun little show where they make it infront of you), a few JUMBO shrimps (seriously, the biggest shrimps I've ever seen), and the mash potato and mushroom sides. The steak was succulent and perfectly cooked. The sides were a bit underwhelming and the cocktail I ordered wasn't that spectacular. Moving to desserts, we had the flourless chocolate cake with mint ice cream and loved it. Thought the mint ice cream was similar to Bang Bang on Ossington. Service was attentive, but we noticed that we didn't get the full explanation of how the meal was cooked like how the other tables did. They fold your napkins for you when you're in the washroom which is nice. They did light a candle on my dessert and wished me a happy birthday but no comp on the dessert, which is fine. Price: expect to pay $150+ per person but the sky is the limit. Overall, definitely an experience and wish we asked to be seated near the piano -next time! One thing that stood out was that all staff wished us good evening on our way in and on our way out. That means a lot!","Sentiment":"positive"}

Another thing was when our server was trying to take an extra place setting away, instead of taking one item at a time, he asked for us to hand him everything on the placemat, which had fork, knives, glass, plates etc. and as I expected everything fell on me... lol...luckily no sharp steak knife. The Cesar salad is still one of my faves. The foie gras looked completely burnt on the outside and mushy on the inside, really turned me off. The bone marrow for some reason tasted like uncooked piece of fat even tho it was cooked... really weird never experienced this before. The steaks were not great cuts for over $400\/piece. One steak was half fat, and the other was too rare. The bass ceviche was light, I enjoyed this dish. We brought our own cake, the fee was $5\/person.

{"Review Text":"Beautiful little neighbourhood gem! The patio was open tonight and we took full advantage, living out our taco dreams. We ordered the whole menu basically, starting with chips and salsa (solid) and ceviche which was perfectly balanced acidity wise and made for a great bite. Of course they also had great margaritas which leaned on the sour side but had a great kick. Next were tacos, and in order of excellence they were: - beef: explosive flavours, crunchy taco shell for texture, chunky guac - fish: perfectly crispy and lightly fried, lot of slaw but went nicely with the lime - chicken: meat was pretty good with the crunch shell and guac once again - pastor: meat was just ok but pineapple was great touch Finally, the reason this place gets that 5th star is the churros. This was probably the best churro I've ever had, with unreal textures of light crispness on the outside and soft doughy inside. It came with a cajete sauce with marshmallows, and that sauce took the churros to the next level. I can't wait to come back if only just for these churros.","Sentiment":"positive"}

They should put a disclaimer when booking a reso, the patio was the only reason we wanted to go in the first place. It was like an hour wait to get a seat outside since it was \"first come first serve\" I have been here two times and both times I went I got attitude from the service.

{"Review Text":"POSSIBLY THE BEST YAKITORI IZAKAYA IN TOWN? I've been to Zakkushi quite a few times over the years, and it's one of my favorite izakaya in town.  Zakkushi has an upbeat vibe as shown by their super energetic staff! Their food quality is excellent and overall I'd say it's a solid 4..  Below are a few items I particularly like: - Tsukune: they mix the minced meat with bits of soft bones, which enhance the texture of the chicken meatball. - Nankotsu: the chicken knee cartilage is so crunchy and chewy. Must try! - Liver \/ Gizzard \/ Heart: just forget about cholesterol level for the night and go all-in. You won't regret it! - Beef tongue: with or without onion on top, both are good. - Yakionigiri: finish the meal with a grilled rice ball is just SO satisfying :) There was a minor issue during my most recent visit, which led me to give them a 4-stars rating (for now).  Our first round of skewers aren't hot enough and don't have the hints of charcoal smell. From second round and on, it's back to their usual high quality. We arrived super early that day, so I wonder if the situation was caused by the charcoal grill still \"warming up\" at the time. I'll definitely go back again, again, and again!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"A very high-quality izakaya. Come here to enjoy Japanese-style BBQ skewers for all kinds of ingredients. We even asked the restaurant to warm up the sak\u00e9 we ordered. Drinking warm sak\u00e9 and eating skewers with friends in a Japanese-style decorated izakaya is a lovely experience on a cold winter night. Be aware that izakaya is just like a bar, it will cost you too much if you want to have \"dinner\" here. It's a good place to hang out with friends and have couple of drink","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Really good Japanese skewer restaurant. Very much focused on skewers and small dishes to taste while have a refreshing drink. Very authentic service and atmosphere where servers welcome you and other customers by shouting really loud in Japanese. The menu changes all the time and is a great place to try authentic Japanese cuisine. Their recent special includes the uni udon and the tofu skewers. Highly recommend the uni udon. If you've never had uni it's very creamy and provides a delicious seafood flavour to the udon. Definite must try. Also highly recommend the Zakkushi skewer set and the chicken karaage. The skewers all have a smoky flavour from the wood fire grill they are grilled on. Each skewer is also so different that it provides a refreshing change of pace and interesting insight into Japanese flavours. The chicken karaage is also fried to perfection with a very crispy skin. It is perfectly paired with a creamy mayo sauce that adds another dimension of texture and flavour. Also would recommend trying out the unique Japanese cocktails and beers that go great with the small bites. The okinomiyaki is very nice if you've never had it before but is much smaller than you think. This place is a great place for drinking and having a small meal. If you're trying to get full it might get a bit pricey as you will have to order more plates. Although the portions may be smaller, it's a great place to try a variety of authentic and delicious Japanese food, plus it also feels like you are in Japan. Definitely give this place a try!!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We came here for lunch right at opening on a weekend and got some melon soda ice cream floats and ordered a variety of skewers. Some of our favourites included garlic shoots wrapped in beef and mochi wrapped in pork belly. They did have a premium beef skewer that we tried. For the price, we would not get it again but it was definitely juicy and well marbled beef. Next time, I'd like to try the grilled fish as it seemed quite popular. The ambiance is that of a typical Izakaya and you can watch the kitchen grill your food on a charcoal grill from certain tables.  Our waitress was super sweet and attentive. Couldn't have asked for a better Japanese Izakaya experience short of booking a flight to Japan.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Portions were very small, but I did not come ravenously hungry, so I was satisfied and happy by the end of the meal. Hamachi sashimi - divine. Sitting atop some very flavourful oils. Foie gras tart with strawberry gel\u00e9 and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche - super different and interesting, but way too rich Rice - very creamy and buttery, the crispy rice on top adds great texture and grapefruit pulp adds a refreshing tang Scallop and mussel in foam - a perfectly seared scallop is the way to my heart Steak - not a steak lover but even I thought this was great. Eggplant tempura on the side. Bread - very rich and oily bread. Adding butter on top seemed like overkill. Came warm. Dessert - a delicate and light peach cake, passion fruit caramel, canel\u00e9, strawberry jelly, and a birthday dulce de leche dessert with candle (not pictured). Although this meal stretched my budget, it was an adventure in food and well worth it for a special occasion.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"With all the hype that Alo gets, my expectations were pretty high coming in for a New Year's Eve tasting menu. We were seated in the bar room, which wasn't very spacious, but had a nice moody aura. Though Alo is labelled as a French restaurant, our seven course meal was surprisingly Japanese, with components like bluefin tuna sashimi, sake kasu, and maitake mushrooms. My favourite courses were the koshihikari rice white truffle risotto and the east coast scallop topped with caviar. Flavours of each dish were well balanced in every course, tasting best with all elements in one bite. Service was great throughout the evening. My friend didn't like the foie gras (our second course), and the waiter promptly replaced it with a citrus-y beet salad. We appreciated that they were well prepared for such a scenario, especially with how rich the foie gras is. Fresh cutlery was provided with every course, with the waitstaff clearing the table in sync. I was content with my experience, and I do think Alo deserves their star, but with a price point of $250pp, I wasn't entirely blown away. You are also required to pay the full amount upon booking. I'd love to come back in the future to see if the dining room experience is different.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"As I recount my latest experience at Alo, I grapple with the final mark: would I still consider them a  \"top pick\"? There were dishes that were incredible, but then some that missed the mark. The tasting menu ($) was off to a shaky start when the canap\u00e9s arrived. We're instructed to eat the four bites in a particular order. The first, an oyster with compressed cantaloupe and Iberico ham oil had a fishy essence without an acidic element (like the traditional mignonette or lemon) to help cut through the strong taste. It also seemed off that it wasn't ice cold for something that should be served uber fresh. The first bite was a bust. Slowly, the redemption started with the beautifully presented uni tart, which was made even creamier with a thick cr\u00e8me fraiche on the bottom. While this wasn't mind-blowing, it was at least not repulsive. After the fishy oyster I had doubts about the mackerel tart, but this was unfounded as the meaty fish was very clean tasting and well balanced with bright pops of the daintiest tomatoes and fruit. Indeed, there was an ocean-like essence from the caviar, but it wasn't overpowering. The canap\u00e9s ended with a foie gras and strawberry jelly tart that created a sweet and savoury element. This was surprisingly good and wonderfully rich. It's unclear if Alo is pandering to Michelin inspectors as the procession of Japanese dishes just seem out of place at a French restaurant. Sure, I can understand if they want to throw in one dish that's has a Japanese influence, but to feature a handful was just too much. Moreover, some dishes just can't live up to what you'd be served during an omakase meal. Chef Patrick Kriss should drop the madai course, a sea bream paired with chili oil, caviar, and kumquat. Like the oyster, it was fishy and warm. Give me this fish cool with freshly grated wasabi and soy sauce any day. The kinmedai was better, the red snapper was at least cold and refreshing with the oh so finely julienned radish in the centre. The various oils complimented the fish nicely and this was an improvement over the other sashimi course. If Alo must have a sashimi course (why would it), one is enough. Having a soft spot for chawanmushi I wouldn't be opposed to this remaining on the menu. The actual steamed egg was hot and silky, but then enhanced with lovely French and Western elements: smooth foie gras tofu cubes, fragrant truffle paste, crunchy radish, sweet corn, and crispy chicken skin. All this amongst a pool of reduced capon broth. What an incredible dish! This is a long review, head to Gastro World for the rest.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I communicated with this restaurant several months in advance and made sure they could accommodate my wife's dietary restrictions for her birthday celebration. They explained they could not modify the menu in their main dining room, but would if we sat in the bar area. Considering the high quality of being a Michelin restaurant, I readily accepted.

{"Review Text":"Food: 9\/\/! The canapes, Hokkaido Scallop, Shima Aji, Wagu & Oyster, East Coast Lobster, Japanese A5 wagyu, Lemongrass & Limquat were all exquisite! Alo definetely has the most unique and unbeatable flavor. However, the pasta dish was not up to my expectations and failed to impress me. But let me tell you about the Japanese A5 Wagyu - it was simply divine! The meat melted in my mouth, and I finally understood what Gordon Ramsay meant by saying how steaks would melt in his mouth. It was so much better than any other steak I've had. Although it did get too fatty in some bites, to the point where I chugged my entire mocktail, I didn't notice the wasabi at first, but once I did, it changed the taste in the most delightful way. As for the Lemongrass & Limequat, it was refreshing and light, and I simply adored it. The Mont Blanc Petit fours were a little too sweet for my taste, but the coffee balanced it out. I especially loved the box that came with the dessert; I wanted to take it home with me! I must commend the waitstaff; they were all lovely and made my dining experience even more delightful. All in all, I truly enjoyed my time here and can't wait to come back!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This place has been on my list for years, it was definitely worth the wait. My boyfriend and I went with the full tasting menu and got a cocktail each with our meals. Here are my thoughts on the courses: 0. Canap\u00e9s - love the presentation and taste of every bit. It was a great balance of unique flavours, mostly savoury and creamy. My favourite bite was the smoked salmon with caviar. The tart crust was so crispy, the salmon was very fresh and the caviar was a great pop of flavour. 1. Hokkaido Scallop - these were the best scallops I've had! Super fresh with a hint of sweetness. The zesty sauce was a great compliment. 2. Wagyu & Oyster - one of my favourite bites of the night. The wagyu was so buttery. I usually don't enjoy raw oyster, but this was very fresh. The . Excellent balance to the buttery wagyu. 3. Shima-aji - these sashimi slices were so fresh. The spot of yuzu really brought out the natural flavour of the fish. 4. East Coast Lobster - thoroughly enjoyed this dish as well. The lobster was springy and sweet. The uni was very creamy with a light salty flavour. The egg based sauce added to the creaminess of the dish. This was a very filling and comforting dish. 5. Koshihikari Rice - this dish resembled a risotto. Loved the mushrooms used. The rice itself was slightly on the saltier side. 6. Swordfish - very unique chewy texture. Loved the flavour of the spicy peppers and sauce. 7. Pecking duck - very tender and flavourful. The pur\u00e9e was an amazing complement to the meaty flavour of the duck. Be sure to eat them together! 8. Provimi Veal Tenderloin - this tasted so much better than it looked. It was one of the most tender steaks I've had. The light salt brings out the natural flavour of the meat. Don't skip out on the eggplant pur\u00e9e! It was an excellent complement to the veal if you wanted a stronger smoky flavour. I should also shoutout the butter milk bread, so soft and buttery! 9. Dessert 1 - love the chestnut praline topping. Inside the chocolate dome contained ice cream and meringue. A delightful dessert with many textures and flavours. 10. Petit Fours - contained yuzu Madeline, chocolate tart. Chocolate rum Choux, and Canel\u00e9. This was my first time having Canel\u00e9 and I absolutely loved it! Overall one of the best dining experiences I've had! The waiter and all the staff were super attentive and friendly. Definitely worth the price :)","Sentiment":"positive"}

We opted to have one regular pairing and share as we're not much of wine drinkers. During the meal they started off every course with a brief explanation of the dish. If there was a wine pairing for the course the wine would come first with an explanation as well. In between courses our utensils were changed as well. All the courses were really good.

{"Review Text":"There's a lot to like about The Keg.  Large space inside with lots of tables and booths and a nice bar for solo diners.  I sat at the bar and had a Keg Classic which is a salad, choice of meats and side.  I opted for the Caesars salad followed by prime rib which was cooked to order, medium rare.  Service was very good. All that said, I can't quite give it five stars.  My vodka soda was on the weak side and glass of Pinot Noir tasted like it came from a bottle that had been open for a while.  The Caesar Salad has just a little too much dressing and I thought the cut of prime rib was not quite top shelf.  I would definitely give it another go, maybe try the house salad and sirloin next time.","Sentiment":"positive"}

It has very charming decor and lighting of old mansion that makes you feel very comfortable. Ordered Never Fail staple food items. Bread and Garlic Butter - We tried our best not to finish the bread before we get all the food we ordered but that garlic butter was too good. Classic Wedge Salad($13) - Very generous amount of blue cheese! Whole Lobster ($60) - Around 2LB whole lobster that was perfectly cooked. Not overdone at all. When dipped in butter, it is the heaven. Think whole lobster is available during \"The Keg Lobster Summer\" Prime Rib 10oz($38) - Again perfect medium rare, so juicy, marbled with fat & tender. Went great with red wine jus, garlic mash & onion crisp. Don't underestimate horse radish. It can make your sinuses explode! Lol. Daily Special Rose Sangria($6) - They had three different sangria and none of them were made with wine. My rose sangria was made with absolute citron vodka. I did not mind at all. Billy Miner Pie($10) - It was complementary. Even though we did not have room for a dessert anymore somehow we finished it. It was that good!! Dinner took a total of 1.. Serving timing was great even though it was a busy night. Only thing bother me with the service was after we finished main meal because of messiness it can get after cracking the whole lobster, there were small bits of lobster food debris everywhere on the table. Wait staff brought the dessert plate without quickly wiping the table and placed it on top of lobster bits on the table. I could not stop the staff and requested to wipe the table first because dessert had candle with the light on. We ended up wiping the table with dessert napkins provided.

{"Review Text":"Tried out DaiLo! Great patio to sit at during summer Sunchoke dumplings; super super creamy and decadent. Crispy octopus tacos: I thought the jicama \"shell\" was nice and gave a very refreshing crispy texture. The octopus was amazingggg and very tender. Rice and hakka pork: very reminiscent of asian style braised pork belly. The pork was an extra : it was topped with small pieces of vegetables, gochugaru onion jam, and a few pieces of crispy wild rice. The jam was slightly sweet which paired nicely with the meet  topped with sweet jam. It has also had bits of asparagus and carrots The dumpling and tacos were my favourite. The smoked duck bokkeum was decent but is quite expensive for the portion tbh, I wish they had more vegetables or sides accompanying the dish. The rice dish is good for filling up on since the other portions are small. Overall I felt while it was good, the price is quite steep.

I love the vibe here, most seatings are booths (very tiny ones, so it's great for ) but the set up looks like a pub in Japan! The servers were also very attentive as well! My bf and I decided to try their Aburi sushi, Gyu tataki (lightly seared beef) , beef tenderloin skewers, pork neck skewers and oysters karaage. Overall, I found the prices to be a little steep as all the dishes were average and nothing to run home about. My least favourite being their Gyu tataki. Pretty much flavourless. The only flavour came from the onions that the beef was sitting on, but the meat itself had no flavour. 2\/5. My favourite would be their oysters karaage, the batter was a bit too thick for my liking however, the flavours were good especially when mixed in with their house made mayo. 3.5\/, it was Sapporo topped with a swirl of icy beer. Very unique, very delicious, can't go wrong with Sapporo! Probably won't get this every time, because at the end of the day it still just taste like a regular Sapporo... just colder. But I think it was worth the experience. 5\/, come here for a chill date with friends for their drinks and the vibe but don't expect much from their food.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"3.5\/5, +., but I wouldn't say excellent. There were a few too many misses with some dishes, but the ones they hit they did an excellent job in. The water pump was interesting, at least I had it on my table where you can pump your own water. No need to ask for a server (unless you ran out of water in that pitcher). Tsukune - Nope. Beef was overcooked for my liking. Maguro Tataki - Love it! Lightly seared properly. Ika Yaki - Love it! There's that strong ika taste that tasted with the food. Japango Roll - Love it! I'm a sucker for aburi rolls.  - I got salmon, tuna, and torched butterfish for my . It was good overall. Oden soup - Meh. Nothing special. Service was good here. Would I come back? They have a pretty extensive menu to allow me to consider coming back, but I'll probably avoid the grilled items next time.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"If you are looking for authentic Japanese food \uff06 drink experiences (like good sashimi, sushi, Asahi beer, or sake) this is not a place to go, but if you want to enjoy a casual Izakaya experience, then it is an OK place. We had - Chicken Karaage - Deep fried Soft Shell crab - Beef tataki - Sashimi (Salmon & Hamachi) - Beef tongue skewer With Asahi Superdry, warm sake, and a few cocktails. Their deep-fried foods were good though the Karaage was a bit dry, with a lot of small pieces. Soft shell crabs had good meaty parts, and I liked them. The beef tataki was ok but the sauce was mysteriously sweet - I expected that tataki to come with sauce with a hint of sourness. I found the sashimi pieces were too thick, ignoring each fish's unique delicacy. I did not like their presentation of sashimi with \"thicker the better\" thinking. I expected that each fish be cut at an appropriate thickness to maximize the unique character, and the hamachi could be better if it was thinner with more slices. But I should not expect such delicacy in this casual Izakaya-like place. I wanted the Asahi to be served chillier. It lost hoppiness and crispness when it was served. Their warm sake was not served at the appropriate temperature - under-warmed, and losing the alcohol punch. Overall, this place does a good job to recreate the Japanese Izakaya atmosphere, giving patrons a good personal space to enjoy chatting with friends.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The lobster miso soup began the dance in our mouth, followed by a wagyu carpaccio or uni ankake chawanmushi (uni with egg custard), then , aburi sushi (pressed sushi pieces) and negitoro hand roll,  (including a piece with wagyu and foie gras and a piece with uni), and the ball ended with a final waltz of the panna cotta. Perfection has never been so tasty. Service was exceptional, and the ambiance was on point as that of an exclusive sushi place.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Wifey chose the spot and did not disappoint. This was a great sushi spot for a date, work dinner, or a casual Thursday. It is on the pricier side but I was not disappointed with the flavor and freshness of the fish. We ordered the sashimi platter (smaller) and the aburicious (). This was the perfect amount of food, we struggled to finish the last piece. If I was very hungry I could've taken down the sashimi platter myself but I wasn't feeling heroic tonight. The restaurant serves two different types of soy sauces for the sushi. One specifically for the red fish and the other for all others. In the middle was flaked salt, I didn't catch what that was for, probably the wagyu? Wifey ate all hers and helped herself to mine. For drinks I enjoyed the two Japanese whiskey's who's names escape me but wifey really enjoyed her beverage, Sakura. Lychee, blueberries, and alcohol, what else could you ask for? Our server was very nice and patient with us as we so indecisive if we wanted to go with the prix fix menu or ordering a la carte. We made the right choice but I am curious how it would've been, although it would've been too much food for sure. From the street it looks like it's closed\/abandoned but just go in and it's got a nice esthetic reminding me of a nyc sushi hot spot in the east village.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Absolutely amazing! I almost missed the place. If it wasn't for the folding sign I would have walked right by. Once you open the heavy black door, you're suddenly inside of a cozy, lightly lit space. Perfect for an after theater dinner. I had made reservations in advance but there was only one other guest for most of our meal. I ordered the aburicious so that I could try a variety and to start I ordered the uni ankake chawanmushi. Everything was beautifully presented, carrying the clean yet elegant decor of the space onto the food. The chawanmushi was steamed flawlessly with the flavors of the uni and kura coming through. It was small yet filling. The pressed sushi though was the highlight. Each bite of melt in your mouth deliciousness made me want to order more even though  I was full. No soy sauce or extras needed. I did trade one of my jabistrolls for one of my friend's hotate since I love scallops. I think my favorite was the wagyu since I'm addicted to anything with yakiniku sauce and the beef was like butter. My friend also ordered the Hokkaido salad which was huge enough for a meal on its own. I tasted a few bites and each of the flavors of the seafood created a different experience each time. I highly recommend this place and will definitely stop by the next time I'm in the area!","Sentiment":"positive"}

We ordered uni nigiri, Aburi chef's choice, Nama - classic nigiri, Hotate carpaccio, Aburicious, and for drinks - Aka murasaki and Yuzu sunrise. Starting off with the appetizer, the Hotate carpaccio was perfectly seasoned and the sauce pulled it all together. My first time trying uni, and I really enjoyed it - it has a really refreshing taste (like the ocean). The nama platter was my favourite dish, the fish pieces were so fresh and fatty. The photo of the drinks was taken after I took a few sips, and I was already feeling the effects. Highly recommend yuzu sunrise! The pressed sushi pieces were also very enjoyable and combined so well. Enjoyed all the dishes, so highly recommend this spot for your next sushi stop!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Nice ramen place! We came here on a weekday only about ! Totally unexpected, so definitely plan your trip if you can. I heard lots of this place being super delicious, but perhaps it was the god fire broth I chose that don't quite meet my expectations. The broth felt oily\/fatty in a non-pleasant way, where it coated the inside of my mouth and felt like it stuck to my lips if licked them. The flavour itself was very nice, but it was the feeling of it that I found a bit unpleasant. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth delicious though! Definitely recommend getting the premium toppings to get extra pork and a delicious ramen egg. One thing I thought was odd was the noodles--they feel like a thin egg noodle vs. a ticker ramen noodle. The noodles are good, but didn't quite meet my expectation of ramen. I may come back to try again, or visit one of their other global locations, but probably not anytime soon.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Came here for the birthday promotion where you get free gyozas the same number as your age! We got the Signature Tonkotsu Ramen which was just okay (a little bland), and the Black Tonkotsu Ramen which was really good (flavourful and not super salty)! This is also the first place we've been to that allowed us to choose the noodle texture too! However, they did not have the option to choose noodle thickness. The Gyozas were also the best that we've ever had! Super crispy and juicy and bite-sized!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"The ackee and saltfish bites ($, $) would make a great hors d'oeuvre. The fried dumpling base is like a fluffy biscuit topped with a mound of creamy ackee and saltfish spread studded with sweet peppers, onions, and tomatoes. It reminds me of a more fluid crab cake with a pop of freshness. The pepper shrimp ($19) still knocked a fiery punch bringing on the scotch bonnet zing while swimming in garlic butter. The sauce seemed much thicker, so it really sticks to the seafood or acts as a dip for the crunchy bread. I wish the kitchen had served the mixed green and mango salad ($17) with the shrimp (instead of with the mains) as it had a refreshing coolness that would have helped tame the spicy shrimp. Ultimately, it's a salad, which was light on the mango but had some tropical flair from toasted coconut chips. Oddly, the jerk pork ($24) was completely devoid of the spice and heat you'd expect and tasted like regular barbeque meat. If anything, my favourite part of the dish was the sauteed greens made from kale, collard greens, cherry tomato, and onion. It's a side that would go great with anything. As with the previous visit, Chubby's saucier dishes continue to impress. While I would have liked more heat in the curry chicken ($19), it was nonetheless tender and flavourful, pairing well with the jasmine rice and pineapple chutney. The gravy from the oxtail stew ($25) was also on point, and pairs well with side dishes like the rice and peas and as a dip for the fried okra ($11). The oxtail was a tad scant on the meat, but what was included was flavourful and tender. I could easily have an entire order of this to myself. Chubby's smartly leaves the fried plantain ($10.50) in large chunks, so they don't dry out. They were the best plantains I've ever had, a slight crispiness outside yielding to the soft fruit, with a sprinkling of salt that enhanced its semi-sweetness. In fact, with a scoop of coconut ice cream and a caramel drizzle, the fried plantains could even sub in for dessert. Consequently, much tastier than the cornmeal pudding ($12), which was too salty and had a non-existent 'pudding' element. If anything, the dessert was merely a piece of corn bread covered with fussy corn nuts and a scoop of mellow coconut sorbet.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"The ambiance and music was great. I really liked the decor of the place as well. However, we came for the food. I've eaten at several Jamaican restaurants which were more casual than this one all over the GTA , and I expected better from Chubby's. The jerk chicken was tender but didn't pack a lot of flavour. The coleslaw on the side tasted very vinegary, there were ... My friend had the goat curry and there was a lot more bone than goat. We also got a side of rice with peas and it was a little dry. The better items on the menu were the jerk wings (the cornbread being the star of that dish), and the fried plantain. I don't know how my friend's drinks were, but I got the Havana Nights cocktail. It was strong but I would have liked a dash of sweetness in there for variety as the flavours in there are mostly bitter with a bit of sour. Service was a little slow, we had to ask to get our water refilled.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Chubby's serves elevated Jamaican food in a cozy interior with romantic lighting perfect for dates! I tried their ackee and saltfish bites, jerk chicken and oxtail stew with a side of slaw. The bites were a bit too salty for me (I should have expected it though so that's on me). The jerk chicken and oxtail stew were tender and packed with flavour. Portions are smaller than expected, but remember you're also paying for the atmosphere\/ambiance here. I recommend getting the slaw with your dishes, it really helped balance things out (and get some veggies in!)","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We arrived at 10pm on a Saturday night and scored a table right away. With most of the tables still occupied and people were still arriving after us, we know we got lucky. What we got: Fried Okra Pepper Shrimp Jerk Pork Oxtail Stew Service was friendly and quick, we were vibin with the music, and the food was delicious! Fried okra has a slightly sweet sauce. The pepper shrimp had a big kick but was still enjoyable. The jerk pork's sauce was slightly thick in a good way that it stuck to the meat with most of the pieces tender. It was accompanied by some of their seasonal saut\u00e9ed greens that I really enjoyed. The oxtail stew's sauce was a bit too liquidy that the flavors didnt stick to the meat as much as I'd like but the meat itself was soft and tender.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Considering the downtown location, unique cuisine choice for the area, and the great ambience I have to give Chubby's an extra star. However on food alone, it would be a . We came on a Friday evening without reservations and was promptly seated in the back patio tucked in a quiet corner which was perfect for us. They had plenty of tables, but looked to be reserved by multiple large parties and the night continued. I would recommend booking a table as it does get busy. Our server was friendly and helpful, recommending oxtail stew over the curry goat while my partner ordered the small jerk chicken. Great flavors for both with the appropriate spice levels. Only complaint is that the portions are 1\/'m use to in the suburbs at almost double the price. However, given the King West location that is to be expected. Also, my goat was a touch too salty for my palate, would definitely need something acidic and bright to balance it out next time.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Detroit style pizza? Delicious! It was my first time having this kind of pizza and it did not disappoint. Perfectly cheesy, not too saucy, and the right amount of crisp. The pepperoni was a bit too burnt, but I guess it had to be so that everything cooks well. I thought it was interesting that the sauce is a dollop onto the pie. Although I'm more of a crust person, the edges were crispy and tasted delicious. I got the garlic parmesan aioli and it was so good!

I thought I would have lots of time, but the service was quite slow as I waited forever to be served. Finally someone checked in on me and took my order. I asked if they could sub arugula for their kale salad and they said they would check, but never got back to me. A long while later, I was served my food with the arugula salad, great I thought.

{"Review Text":"Came here back in december with some friends and we ordered: Anchovies Sourdough bread Quarter octopus Patatas bravas Pork jowel Mushrooms Steak I've come here a few times over the years and each time the food is really great but the service is very mediocre unfortunately and has not gotten any better. I'm not sure if it's maybe just my luck but out of the four times I've been here, not one time was th service even above average. Each time I'm here we are always waiting a long time on service or asking for water. The fastest service is when the bill comes. Not sure if anyone else has had better experiences here with the staff?","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Excited for this place since I always see it on Instagram. My boyfriend and I here came here for dinner and decided to share the , grilled mushroom with cured egg yolk and jamon croqueta. We also decided to order a house cocktail. The dry aged steak was probably one of the steaks I've had! The meat was very tender and savory with a nice hint of smokiness. I also really enjoyed the mushrooms and egg yolk dish. It was super flavorful and the egg yolk added an extra layer of flavour. The croqueta was also creamy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Overall really enjoyed all the dishes here (definitely on the more expensive side)! Service was great as well!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"A cozy place on the western part of College Street near Ossington. Due to the streetcar constriction (hope it will finish soon!) , the access was a bit tricky at this time, but in spite of this, the restaurant was FULL of people by 6:30pm (Friday). I am glad I made a reservation. Was a perfect place to catch up with my girlfriend with great food and drinks after busy weekdays. Even though the place was busy - the a dimly lit interior somewhat gave us a sense of privacy. The service was excellent. Our server was very good at giving details about the menu to us, his descriptions\/suggestions were so good that I wanted to order almost every dish he mentioned! He was also friendly and attentive. We (two) had the following dishes: Food: Shishito Peppers Sea Bream Ceviche & Chips Grilled Octopus (Quarter) Roast Veal Bone Marrow Drink: Isabel Fashioned \u00a1Rebujito! And some draft beer and local craft beers. Impressed by the Roast Veal Bone Marrow. The melty bone marrow came with toasted multigrain sourdough & refreshing Parsley Verde & good quality sea salt. Each item was simple, but eating together - soooo good! Loved this. The grilled octopus was excellent as well. Tender, perfectly seasoned, and goes very well with butter sauce with a hint of sourness. Eating with the saut\u00e9ed dandelion underneath the octopus gives another layer of flavor (nice bitterness). Enjoyed this, thank you!!! The shishito was nicely seasoned, fried perfectly leaving the plumpness\/crispiness of the peppers. They weren't too pungent or overly salty at all. I loved the shaved salt sprinkled around the peppers. Sea Bream Ceviche was the least favorite food of the night, but they are still good. Just felt that it is not worth the price. Will come back for sure, this is a place for the well executed food and excellent service!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"When I can't go to Spain I come to this OG Spanish spot! The past few times I've been here, they either ran out or weren't serving my favorite Foie Gras Toast (cured meat, honey and shaved truffle on a crunchy bread ?). But this time I made sure to call in advance and reserve an order, which ended up being the very last one of the night. Grilled Mushrooms & Cured Egg Yolk: This was pretty good, the egg yolk had a bit of rich\/saltiness and the mushrooms were grilled nicely Quarter Octopus: This just ended up being 1. (about ) and was $32 :\/ Roast Veal Bone Marrow: Can't really go wrong with this accompanied with a side of tangy chimmichuri sauce Cured Chorizo (?): Buttery and full of flavor, one of my favorite cuts of cured meat Foie Gras with Peaches: This was really tasty, the peaches were sweet and caramalized and the foie gras was slightly salty, rich and buttery. The food is pretty much the same as before except the prices are higher cause inflation. I also noticed resos aren't as hard to snag as they used to be which is a plus, and walk ins generally have zero wait time now. For a very casual dinner, it was over $. I honestly find it quite steep now for some items","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"My friend invited me to try this place before they closed down for renovations. The staff knew their menu well and have good recommendations when it comes to which drink goes well with what dish. We ordered the deluxe bento box which is like a sampler set of nine dishes, the nigiri special, the tiger prawn tartare, the beef tongue, a bottle of sake, yuzu G&T, Moscow mule, and the Doraemon drink. 1) Bento Box I don't remember which dishes came in the set but I really enjoyed the ebi mayo the most. I believe it also came with karaage, salmon, beef, corn, and others. There's enough food to share with another person as well. 2) Nigiri Special The fish they used is from Taro Fish. Not much to say except for it being fresh. The Nigiri already has wasabi added to it so it doesn't come with any on the side. The tuna tataki bowl was also pretty good. 3) Tiger Prawn Tartare The dish comes with garlic toast and the tartare is mixed with avocado. It was quite lovely and I enjoyed the garlic toast. 4) Beef Tongue I've never really tried this before and it was unexpected. I did find the meat to be slightly salty but the sauce it came with complements the beef tongue well. 5) Drinks The bottle of sake we ordered was recommended by the staff as it pairs well with the fish on their nigiri plate. The cocktails were regular but I liked the yuzu g&t the most. The food is what you'd expect from an izakaya and a bit on the pricier side too. But I would come back and try their noodles next time since I didn't get the chance to. The service was good, the food came pretty quickly and the server was attentive.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This place is so cute, and I can't wait to come back! I just wish it wasn't situated in a quieter part of town because I'm so used to downtown core. But I'll trek out to come here again. Really nice and cozy vibes, great to meet friends or for a date. My friend and I really came here for the bento after seeing it on IG multiple times. It was a really nice and tasty experience seeing what each block was\/contained and then trying it. Each part was delicious and it was like a mini omakase experience but definitely without the $$$ price tag (it was $35). I had some friends comment on my IG story about how it looks like places you'd find in Vancouver! Their bento does change, so I would definitely go back We also ordered an eel roll which I don't remember the name now. It was really delicious but there was some type of leaf in the roll that my friend and I both didn't like -- the taste was quite overpowering unfortunately. I did see the tables around us also order the bento box in addition to actually getting some grilled products so I'd love to come back and try to grill things. This is one place I'd actively go back to Cabbagetown for!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"An amazing izakaya that really focuses on great food with fresh ingredients. The beer and cocktail menu has a lot of variety and I liked that they had creative non-alcoholic cocktails too. I'm very sad to see they are closing for renovations and rebranding on Nov 1, but have faith that the management will re-open with something wonderful with a bit of Kingyo's old charm. If you want to enjoy the original Kingyo menu, better book a table ASAP. There's a . So you can't stay here all night but that's good news for waiting list people to know tables will open up at regular intervals. The vibe is very chill and the servers are so friendly. We ordered a lot of food and she paced everything so well. The next wave of dishes came out only when we were done what was in front of us. We started with the hot stone beef tongue. I love tabletop cooking and the beef was sliced nice and thin. The stone's temperature was enough to slightly sear and cook it tenderly without turning it rubbery. The server was happy to bring another stone if it got too cold to continue cooking. Pressed sushi came next. Saba is my favorite fish and the sushi portion here was very meaty! The rice was just the right amount. Spicy Toro was ok. I think the spicy sauce overpowered the tuna and I couldn't taste much else. It's the one thing I probably would not order again. The Makunouchi bento is very popular and one of their signature menu items. Lots of little dishes to sample a variety of traditional Japanese flavors. This on its own is good for just snacking on while drinking with your buddies. My favorites were the miso glazed grill fish, fried ebi, and deep fried tofu nuggets. It's possible the dishes in the box differ from the printout, and your server will tell you in advance what was substituted. Our chirashi came last and at this point I was happy they were mini! Topped with fresh seafood and beautifully presented. I enjoyed what I could but had to ask for a box to eat the rest at home. They surprised us with complimentary ice cream and strawberries as a gift for our anniversary! It was a very nice way to end off the night. For the ladies: their washrooms have complimentary grooming and hygiene items to help you freshen up!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Mini Sea Urchin & Snow Crab Chirashi - Apparenlty I missed the word \"mini\" because when this dish came out I was shocked at how small it was. It was my first time having Uni! Very creamy, but there was a noticable fishy after taste (which my friend said is quite normal). Stone Bowl Eel Unagi Don: one of the best eel rice bowls I've had! They topped it with egg omelet, takana, dried seaweed, and scallions and it really elevated the dish a made a huge difference in terms of texture and flavour. Kaarage: Really juicy and tender, I enjoyed this, and wish it came with more than ! Sushi: we got , I honestly don't remember all the names. These were decent but the rice wasn't packed tight enough as it kept breaking when we tried to pick it up. The fish was on the softer and fishier side then I prefer. Kingyo has recently announced they will be restructuring their restaurant and menu starting November 1st so you can look forward to new dishes when they re-open!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Yea things have changed since the dine-in days haven't they? Forget about what the server said, how you didn't get your water glass filled right away, now it's all about the FOOD! There's a massive menu on-line where you can buy whole fish, fresh or frozen, etc., but I grabbed a small paper menu from the counter which is accessible inside the restaurant where you will be greeted by a friendly server. I scanned the menu and the (Lunch Only) lined grabbed my attention and it was Beef Fillet Steak Bento, hmmm, that sounded fine at $19. They said to give them , so I went for a stroll around Cabbagetown, trying not to stray too far. Right on the dot I was back and my meal was ready, boom! The steak was fantastic! It was great to have a meal like this as a takeaway. The sides were tasty as well, with a tuna salad, chef's dish, and pickles, according to the menu. See my closeup pics for more details. The chef's knife skills made for a gorgeous looking bento box, and the subtle charring of the veg and steak introduced a nice smoky flavour from the hibachi. This place is sooooo good I want to go back again soon and try more items like the Makunouchi Bento $25, or the Kaisen version for $24. Maybe someone out there can point me to other items good for a lunch meal from this menu as everything is reasonably priced and I'm sure will be over the top good!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We went on Monday evening for dinner for two, a couple of months ago. To our surprise, a lot of the Izakayas were closed on Monday. So we decided to venture out to the east end to satisfy our cravings. Atmosphere & Service: There's a bit of construction happening at the restaurant storefront, so we did have a bit of difficulty finding the main entrance around the maze of scaffolding. The restaurant floor area was larger than I had expected. Divided in essentially three different zones - two of which are near the open kitchen. The other is surrounded by vintage Japanese slot machines on the walls. The servers here are friendly and extremely attentive. Food & Taste: We ordered . Our order: - Kingyo Bento ($35) - Could be a cute order for date night. The bento includes , fried seafood, steamed egg, grilled fish, beef tartare, etc. I believe the bento changes on a daily basis. - Red Tuna Carpaccio ($9.80) - Full of flavour with complementary sauce and greens. - Stone Grilled Beef Tongue ($14.80) - Very theatrical dish. The dish came with a decent amount of tongue. Personally, I would have preferred the wagyu beef over the beef tongue. Overall great value. - Saba Stick Sushi ($12.80) - One of the best mackerel sushi I have ever had. The cut was extremely thick, but not too overpowering. - Stone Bowl Seafood Sea Urchin Don ($16.80) - Great carb dish to top off your meal. The stone bowl don was loaded with bits of juicy shrimp, scallop and sea urchin. Best bang for your buck. Price: Overall, the dinner amounted to $100, not including tips. For presentation, service, and taste I would say it was extremely worth it. The servers spaced out all our dishes, so the service was pretty much omakase-style. If I am in Cabbagetown, I would stop by again to get the Saba Stick Sushi, Kingyo Bento and the Stone Bowl Seafood Sea Urchin Don.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I ordered the couples platter which is a sampler of many items and the \"trendy\" mazeramen (dry ramen). Couples Platter: - . One with the cold items and one with the hot (fried stuff) - SO MUCH VARIETY... it came with SO MANY SAUCES too! I was surprised. Wish they were labelled so I would have known what they were. I don't think the sauces were even mentioned in the item description. For example, it came with ... one of them was a ponzu JELLY, and there were at least . One seemed less salty. The fried box had ketchup for the fries, hot sauce, a mayo that was more vinegary, and a more savory mayo with onion and garlic. I enjoyed them both! It was hard not to make big scoops of the mayo - all in all, everything was yummy and great a combo Trendy mazeramen: - Ive had soupless ramen many times from different places, including the OG that this ramen is trying to copy. It looks good and similar at the surface level, but thats about it. This was TOO dry... just because its soupless doesnt mean it has to be dry with no SAUCE. I think its lacking oil and also flavour - I ended up saving it for later so that I could add my own sauce and additional toppings for flavour (fried mushrooms, onions, hot sauce and sesame oil)","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"The bento boxes and chirashi bowls are not only super colourful and pretty to look at, but they also taste extremely delicious, healthy, and fresh. You get a 'clean eating' feeling after having a meal at Kingyo. All their dishes are plated beautifully, and they exhibit the true Japanese-style presentation where each bento box is made up of dozens of high-quality, fresh ingredients and each mini item is crafted to perfection. They pay a lot of attention to detail in terms of presentation and variety in their dishes, especially the bento boxes. The bento boxes are closer to what you'd actually find in Japan (made up of lots of small portions of goodness, and everything is balanced so perfectly - the protein, carbs, veggies - lots of greens!).","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"A popular restaurant in Yorkville serves classic English cuisine with a country\/home-style menu. If you like game and other meats, but want relatively \"classic\" cooking, this is the place to go! I've only been here a couple times, but really enjoyed it! It's also known to be a great place for a drink - the intimate and cozy setting is quiet and secluded and not too crowded. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointment and to make sure you have enough accommodation. All things aside, prices here are on the high side, so for me, going to Oxley is an absolute treat. The food here is reasonably portioned and being in Yorkville, plus their unique menu, it all makes sense. If you like their food, that's great! I don't think everyone likes the food here, so be sure to check out the menu and research what's available before you come. Also, there are daily specials so make sure you ask and don't be shy - is it hot or cold, raw or cooked ...... If something on the menu doesn't sound familiar, all questions are reasonable and necessary to get a feel for the dish. I really appreciated their service, they were very patient with all our requests and it made for a very good experience.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"The Oxley, like it's sister pub Queen and and Beaver downtown, excels in creating a great English pub atmosphere with great beer and drink options. However, the food, despite some efforts at upscale English pub food, falls apart a bit on the execution. The fish and chips plate looked great, but was seriously under-seasoned, and the batter was falling away from the fish. The fries were likewise under-seasoned, and also cut thick and under-fried, creating more of a baked potato effect. The tartar sauce, homemade and in an individual ramekin, was ice cold and rock-hard, likely spooned out in advance of service and left in the fridge. I cut it with a knife! The interior is great, all dark wood and antique furniture. The crowd is on the mature side and they appear to do a brisk after work business. A great pub for a drink and conversation, but the food falls short of its ambitions.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"RECOMMEND:  Three decades since I'd lunched in Yorkville and I wandered in to The Oxley and was rewarded!  Good service & ambiance sitting inside at the bar during the heatwave but the seating outside would be fantastic on the right weather day or hour. Grilled Atlantic Salmon with Yukon dumplings & peas served in an accent broth. If this pub was in Los Angeles I would go there often. If you are local take advantage of their delicious fare!","Sentiment":"positive"}

We did tappa's all around and is the best way to enjoy this place. Bone marrow with the beef topper was off the hook. Best dish of the night. Second best dish was the garlic shrimp. So good and flavourful. I loved the sauce i scooped it out with a spoon and put it on my bread. The dishes I was not impressed with. The tomato bread was tasteless. No salt or olive oil. So you have amazing bread and nice tomatoes with great presentation but no seasoning.  This may have been a kitchen mistake I have no idea but not to standard. The chicken liver pate was a bit funky. Something in the dish made it sour either the jam or something to do with the topping threw the dish off. Cheese dishes are a bit disappointing. For almost $.

The combination of the walnuts and figs added a great texture and taste to the dish as well. Pulpo $\/'t make sense to me. The octopus was done well, but the combination with the potatoes just did not go very well. It was also quite bland. Roasted bone marrow $.75\/. There was not a lot of bone marrow, and the lack of flavor by the bone marrow was compensated with the beef cheek marmalade. Paella patria $\/ (or 'homeland' paella). The seafood was cooked well but the rice just tasted like tomato rice with a tiny bit of salt. The seafood was tasty and on the saltier side so my partner was wondering if they made the rice less salty so you can eat it together. I do agree that the seafood and rice go well together if eaten together but there was too much rice for that. I'm not complaining that there wasn't enough seafood. The rice just lacked flavor. Churros $.75\/ (dulce de leche and coffee chocolate) had the perfect amount of sweetness. I loved the bitterness of the chocolate as well. A bit pricey though. Tres leches $.5\/.

{"Review Text":"(3.5) Patria is a new age, cozy Spanish restaurant with a modern twist. Right in the middle of the Fashion\/Entertainment district, it has the spark needed to thrive. We came in for the dinner service recently during the weekend. As we were seated, we were given the rundown on cocktails and how the menu is structured. As a predominantly Spanish tapas cuisine, there were many tapas options with entr\u00e9e and paella options available. Along with a pitcher of sangria, we settled on Pimientos De Padron, Oveja Con Trufa La Quesera, the Beef Tartare, Whole Branzino and the Paella Patria. All in all, all the dishes came out on time and cooked well; nothing really to report on the peppers and the cheese. The beef tartare was fresh and well-seasoned, however there was quite a bit of water\/liquid at the bottom of the plate. The dish was also served with some crackers, but there was no where close to being enough for the amount of crackers for the tartare; we used the sourdough that came with the cheese which actually was better suited for the dish in my opinion. The Branzino and Paella came out next - visually it was picturesque and the freshness of the ingredients was apparent. Both dishes were slightly under seasoned, but tasty nonetheless. The Paella looked and tasted great (other than being a bit under seasoned), I think they missed the mark when it came to Socarrat. Typically the tastiest and most fought after part of the dish, our Socarrat was nonexistent. Service was excellent and helpful, will likely return to try other dishes.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"One of the few spots on King West I frequent, Patria does spanish food incredibly well. Their paella is great and they have a lot of other great classic dishes - especially their meats and cheeses. To be frank, I remember this spot being a bit better pre covid - it was an easy  - and I still love Patria but it didn't quite blow me away as well as it did before. Here's the rundown of the food: - Croquetas: delicious mushroom croquetas with a truffle relish, I love the texture on these - Crudo: a classic with perfect balance of acidity - Pan Con Tomate: one of my favourites, so simple yet so elegant - Meatballs: these were much better when they were wagyu, but they're still pretty good now - Patatas Bravas: another one of our favourite dishes with lots of egg and a lightly crispy potato - Seafood Paella: loved the scallops especially but I do remember it being seasoned differently when I came here pre-Covid, still pretty good nonetheless Overall I'd say this is a delicious spot to try and I love the vibes here - especially the art with some wonderful paintings on the east side of the restaurant. It's on the pricey side, but worth experiencing at least once.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Happy Saturday everyone! I visited patria last weekend and enjoyed some authentic paella and tapas. We got the following: - Paella Patria: argentinian gulf shrimp, pei mussels, fish, peas, clam, saffron - Croquetas de Setas: porcini mushrooms, manchego cheese, truffle aioli (not pictured because we gobbled it up ) - Gambas: argentinian gulf shrimp, garlic, parsley - Sorpresa Cava Sangria: white wine, raspberry peach liqueur, fresh lime, cranberry, rose cava, tart, citrus, light herbed essence The paella was cooked so perfectly, the shrimp were juicy and plump, along with the fresh seafood and saffron rice it all tied together so well! I just wish the flavour was a bit more bold, again this could just be a personal preference for me and my inner Indian craving spice lolol but definitely recommend it for anyone that likes their dishes on the milder side The croquetas were so yummy with the cheese and mushroom stuffing! We inhaled these so quickly and unfortunately didn't get a picture but we throughly enjoyed them The gambas were my favourite pick out of the tapas, you cannot go wrong with these !!!! They're HUGE, juicy and absolutely delicious Last but certainly NOT the least is the super tasty sopresa sangria, the combination of wine and raspberry peach liqueur worked so perfectly with the garnishes, I almost wish I ordered a jug all to myself lol but maybe next time! Overall we had an awesome experience dining at patria, our server was really nice and had great suggestions! The restaurant has beautiful decor inside with a very warm, cozy atmosphere bustling with people enjoying their meal and having a good time.

{"Review Text":"First time visitor from California! Wanted to try a different cuisine than what I normally lean towards. The ambiance is great and service was also good (not overly spectacular but nothing to complain about either). We were hungry after an event and ordered several items to try. 1. Bone marrow app: came out suspiciously fast but didn't mind one bit (at first). The beef cheek shredding on top seemed like a good twist but honestly, it was only OK, slightly dry, and lukewarm. Didn't feel like it added much. It also came with . Wished we had better toast & more of it to enjoy the marrow. 2. Chicken liver pate app: It had a fruit (?) jelly layer that was set on top. While this is a good idea to cut the richness of the pate, this jelly tasted horrible. It was like cherry cough medicine. Otherwise, the pate itself was good (not amazing). But it was still served with the stale toast. 3. Veggie paella: menu said it would take ! It was fine but again, not amazing. 4. Lamb chops: we ordered the half rack. The waiter said chefs recommended this dish cooked medium well and I had never heard of such a recommendation. It's nearly always medium rare or medium in my experience. This dish didn't taste bad in any way but the flavors were all wrong and I did not enjoy it one bit. WAYY too much going on. The chops had a sherry cumin rub on the outside and sat on top of a pepper sauce. They were then smothered in a chimichurri sauce and lastly coated with loads of sesame seeds. I could barely taste the flavor of the lamb. Also, the menu said they are coated in hazelnut but I guess they only had sesame seeds. I don't prefer sesame seeds and wished the waiter could have at least told us. Overall, I wouldn't come back and can't recommend this place.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Got to visit this restaurant recently and I loved the experience here. Had a very upbeat atmosphere, but wasn't overly loud or crowded. Our server was very very nice and the food came out pretty quickly. We ordered drinks as well as food. I got the red Lotus, which was a suggestion from our waiter, who said it was his favorite cocktail it's definitely mine too. I loved that this cocktail was refreshing but also sweet. It kinda reminded me of those Asian jelly cups that I had as a kid. As for the food, we got the Saigon wings which were grilled but they were super crispy and juicy. I love the kick of flavor it had. We also got these deep fried shrimp balls that were also very delicious and I like the sauce it came with. We also got a pork belly dish to share. The pork belly was tender and flavorful and the fermented veggies complemented the pork perfectly. Overall, I highly recommend this place and come check it out!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I've been a long time fan of the cocktails @dzo_vieteatery but am lately obsessed with their lemongrass beef balls brunch menu item.

Pictured are their vegan taro spring rolls, beef tacos topped with fried shallots, dry chicken pho  - they were all magnificent For drinks we had the Lantern Dragon rum cocktail thoughtfully made with dragon fruit, basil, lime and lemongrass, and the Red Lotus which is a delectable lychee cocktail. I am totally blown away and will definitely return to try more items on their menu.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"It's not the best BBH or pho I've had, but it gets the job done if you have a soup craving. BBH wasn't spicy and didn't have the typical condiments like shrimp paste and chili oil. I would get their pho vs BBH if I had to choose. I would say def come here for their apps and main entrees. I enjoyed their snails that was marinated in a flavorful sauce to dip your banh mi in. I also appreciate their vegan\/vegetarian options, making dining with friends with food restrictions easier! The restaurant was decorated nicely and I liked how spacious it is, so it's great for large parties.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Came here with a friend and we're seated right away. The staff members were friendly and quick. I got the pho which wasn't super special. It tasted like pho you can get anywhere else. I wish the broth was more rich. My friend got a beef dish which was super tasty. Would definitely come back here to try other dishes as other items on their menu peaked my interest!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Rating based solely on the dry pho beef noodles and the vibes ! I love it so much . The soup on the side kept me wanting more !  The noodle dish on its own also had flavour so you can enjoy the noodles both with\/ without dipping the noodles . The beef basically tasted like the same in the vermicelli bowl ! The decor is simply magical ! Love the lantern \/Asia feel to the restaurant . Some not so positive points- the seats are so uncomfortable. Very hard and hurts the bum:( Table size is also very small and the chairs have no place to hang your purse or put it behind since it is not a full back chair. Unfortunately it was raining that day and we forced to either put our purse on our laps or ground. I tried my friend's chicken in the vermicelli and it was really dry . Also tried the Bo lot at Viet festival last year at Dundas Square and it was just regular ie would not get it again","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Love this Viet fusion style place! The vibe is so cool inside and a great place to hang out with friends. We ordered the Photine and it was amazing, imagine poutine with beef and pho flavours! The Bo Bun Hue was really flavourful and not spicy like at most other restaurants. The lemongrass beef with rice was yummy too. Service was also quick and attentive.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"The decor\/design in here is amazing. The lanterns, tile, skylights, foliage all paint a beautiful picture. Service was lacking -- it wasn't super full in the restaurant or the section we were seated in yet we found ourselves waiting for a bit between check-ins. My pork belly entree also came out like 's meal. Not a huge deal but kind of unusual. They were apologetic about it. My Lantern Dragon cocktail was a but sweet for my taste. I know that's a risk you run with dragon fruit but I couldn't taste any lemongrass at all which is why I ordered the drink. Old Hanoi was \"good as hell.\" The spring rolls held up to the hype -- they were really good and a generous portion. Crispy and very flavorful. 5\/5. I wanted to like the coconut clams, and enjoyed the flavor, but it was *super weird* that the dish was basically served at room temperature. I can't imagine that's intentional? Not when it's served in a crock. The pork belly clay pot was bomb. Incredibly tender pork belly - and a lot of it - with the marinated egg, nice pickled veggies to brighten it up, served with rice. Mm! I would happily order that again. Probably regret getting anything else. We were looking forward to the egg salted snails dish but they were out, unfortunately. Maybe call ahead to see if it's available before you go if that's important to you.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We came to TOCA for an early 5:30pm dinner, and were seated to the side of the dining room. The ambience in the restaurant is lovely, with a plethora of frames adorning the walls, unique light fixtures, and elegant furnishings. We ordered the spaghetti alla carbonara and pesce spada (swordfish). The carbonara was tossed in a parmesan wheel right in the center of the restaurant, and tasted pretty good. I was less impressed with the fish, which leaned on the bland side. The gnocchi was the better part of the dish, rather than the protein centerpiece. We got a peach dessert that was on the menu in honour of TIFF, and because it was my partner's birthday, they also brought us a complimentary slice of cassata (ice cream cake with pistachio, rosemary, and rhubarb). Both desserts were delicious. Service here did not disappoint - we really felt well taken care of throughout our meal. Since TOCA is located inside the Ritz, it may be hard to notice without online research. If the taste of the food was improved a notch, this restaurant would be a prime location for a special occasion.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I had supper Monday evening  at TOCA with friends. It's the first time we have all been together in . I had Tagliatelle Bolognese (Beef and Pork Bolognese, Green Peas, Olive Oil). It was good but cold. I didn't want to make a fuss so ate it as it was. One friend is retiring and I retired last year so Luis, our server, surprised us with two desserts to share. Luis was friendly and helpful and took excellent care of us. Because we were a party of six, a 20% service charge was automatically added.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"We like it. The lobster is our favorite but there's nothing that we haven't liked in our two visits. The service everywhere at the Ritz-Carlton is exceptional. It feels so warm and genuine. It really sets them apart. We had our first date here and we came back to celebrate our one year anniversary. Same place, same table, same people, one year later. We spent the day at the spa before dinner and the moment the cat was out of the bag about our anniversary, everyone in the hotel seemed to know. I don't know how they pass the word around but it does make you feel special and that they really care. As for ambience, it's the Ritz-Carlton and it's got the ambience of luxury and class. Not in an intimidating way either. Nothing worse than an ambience that is pretentious. Not here. They are nice across the board. Thanks to all the staff that we crossed paths with. The hostess at Toca was so lovely. Luis, our server was a perfect professional and equal parts warm and caring. Vincent, the general manager and sommelier can't go without mentioning. The wine he helped us choose really completed our night. We'll be back!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Just delicious! I went with a friend for the Winterlicious menus but got several drinks and food a la carte from their regular menu. Been wanting to go for a while and I did not regret it when I finally got the chance. They have a wide range of both mocktails and cocktails. If the ones we tried they were all fantastic and fun. Whatever your fancy there is something for everyone. The appetizers were amazing too. House baked breads and calamari. Though I'm not the biggest fan of calamari this has to have been one of the best experiences I've ever had. Tender, salty, and flavourful. Great way to start the meal. The steak was similarly succulent and beautifully plated. Since, we were here and surrounded by cheese wheels we also had to try some pasta. Though the cacio e pepe looked amazing and was being prepared table side the carbonara was calling me. It was so rich and creamy. All the dishes really left me fulfilled but still wanting more. For dessert there we got tiramisu and rum cake. I probably would have passed on the cake had it not been on the prix fixe menu. However, given they have other new seasonal options I might have gone for something else like a yuzu sorbet had it been on the menu then. Overall, Toca is just an amazing dining experience from the elegant restaurant, to the fantastic and friendly service, and the mouth watering food. I'd highly recommend everyone go at least once. I'm personally checking my day planner for when I will have an opportunity to drop by again. One small criticism is their chair leather is falling apart. They have seen the best of their days and really should be replaced to help round out the environment and experience.","Sentiment":"positive"}

For my main I ordered the homemade gnocchi, which was DELIGHTFUL! FRESH, FLUFFY AND FULL OF CHEESE My friend ordered the turkey sandwich with fries, and I must say it was the largest sandwich I have ever seen (looked very good as well) For desserts, we ordered the tiramisu (10\/10) the CAFF\u00c8 CREMA BRUCIETTA ( 10\/10) and the staff were generous enough to present an additional dessert for the special occasion, which was a cheesecake and a chocolate cake.

{"Review Text":", pavlova and rack of lamb. I know this is a steak house so I deducted one star since my husband's steak did not meet our standards. Maybe the filet mignon would've been more tender but the dry aged steak was tough and chewy. Drinks are strong here! I appreciate it since this place is pricey. The place is small but has enough workers to accommodate every table. I'm guessing they sat us next to the bathroom since we made last minute reservation. My husband didn't mind it but I hated the fact people were in and out of the bathroom constantly with the door just few ft away from me. If this kind of stuff bothers you, speak to your host before seating!!","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"A traditional steakhouse, nothing to write home about. Went here on my colleague's suggestion on the best steak he ever had, but wasn't really impressed. As a standard fare the ribeye and filet were ok. The surprising standout was the spicy crispy brussel sprouts, the vinegar flavour was a surprise and they were really good. The place is dimly lit and very traditional. Our server was nice and helpful, so service was great. Overall, decent place, but I would probably try somewhere else for the price of barberian's food.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This was a spur of the moment place to eat. It's dark and old decor. The food was good,  I had the onion soup and the pickled veggies were different and tasted good. The filet was cooked correctly and the baked potatoes, there is a person that comes around to top it. My wife had the tomahawk pork chop and they will ask you the temperature but she is a well done type of person. She said it was good. The reason for the 's glass where she had a soda pop and then gave me tap water.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"From what I had heard about this place, I was expecting a lot more. For two people the total bill came to $480. That was one snack, two salads, two mains and two desserts. Zero alcohol. The service wasn't that great. Our server forgot about us for most of our time there, and to be honest, the food was just OK.  If I'm gonna spend that kind of money I would expect the food\/service to be a lot better. The pricing on the menus have gone up significantly from the ones that are posted here on the Yelp profile.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Barberian's is an institution for a reason, as they know their way around the classics and keeps their quality high despite years in the field and a solid reputation. Service is seamless and ensures a comfortable meal. We took the opportunity during a recent celebration to come for a meal. Do not be fooled by the simple white nondescript entrance, as the restaurant is expansive inside with a dark cozy atmosphere. Think dark woods and dim lighting. We had the croquettes, french onion soup, the porterhouse steak, and strawberry cheesecake to finish. Everything from start to finish was perfectly executed. The porterhouse steak was of course the standout, as every bite was medium rare and delicious. A wonderful place to have a memorable meal!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"It's been a long time since we went to a steakhouse.  I wanted to have a traditional experience and we certainly got that, very tight, and crowded on a Saturday night.  Lighting was dark as expected, maybe a bit too dark.  We shared a 24oz rib steak with some side dishes.  Steak was cooked to perfection, perfectly juicy, enjoyed the cut.  Seasoning was mild with the Barberian's steak seasoning.  Service was good without being amazing given how tight it was in there with tables fairly close together.  The sides were garlic bread (amazing!), fries, button mushrooms, and their traditional pickled vegetables (also amazing! and provided to every table - nice touch).  We would go back but in a larger group, clientele were mostly regulars, there were certainly no Instagram influencers here and that was refreshing for a change.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Very good steakhouse.  Typical old school steakhouse ambience and service.  Started with six very nice oysters.  For a main, had the bone in large rib eye.  By US standards, not too large, but it was cooked perfectly and had a nice flavor.  I found the wine list light on reasonably priced options, though we did have a very nice Frank Family Zinfindal.  My only disappointment was a side order of saut\u00e9ed onions, which weren't very good.  They were not caramelized and not even cut well, had big half circle sections.  The steak, though, made it an excellent evening.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Awful service. Let me just say if your not white don't expect to receive good service.

{"Review Text":"Koh Lipe is on the Michelin Guide, which peaked my interest in trying this restaurant. We ended up waiting about 't get a chance to make a reservation, which was a mistake. Make sure to have a reservation if you plan on dining here. This place was packed, probably because of how good the food is! The restaurant looks quite eccentric, with lots of colours and tropical decor. Makes you feel like you are eating in Thailand! It is on the smaller side, however, so you'll be very close to your neighbouring tables. We ended up sitting on the outside patio since there was no space inside. We ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and the Khao Pad (Pineapple Fried Rice with Chicken). The Chicken Pad Thai was probably the best Pad Thai that I've had for sure. It was super flavourful, and the side of peanuts is such a great addition to a Pad Thai. The only thing was that there was a too many bean sprouts (I usually prefer more noodles over bean sprouts). The coconut sticky rice that comes with the fried rice was SO GOOD. The chicken was super spicy (probably should have ordered mild), but the coconut rice does a good job of cooling your mouth down.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We felt like Thai for dinner and decided to visit this neighborhood joint, and we're far from disappointed! The place had an amazing Thai vibe, two floors and a patio that was jam packed with patrons. We had to wait about , but there were so many places just outside to look at. We started with the coconut soup, with chicken. The aroma with such a milk infusion of lemon grass, citrus and coconut hits your face as the waiter places in front of you, and I have to admit that's when I started heavily salivating. The soup was loaded with fresh chicken slices, and topped with coriander, great combination, and a little on the spicy side, just how we like it. I had the Thai ice tea, and it really does taste like what they make in Thailand, there was a delicate balance of herbs, a robust tea taste, and the sweet creaminess of the condensed milk, wow, perfection! I would highly recommend this if your into Thai ice tea. In fact I would probably go back just to have this with their mango sticky rice (which I've had at a previous dinner here). Our appetizer came, warm, crispy, and loaded with filling. The tofu roll had a good amount of shrimp, and other items, this was also spicy, but it came with a sweet cause to dip into, which was a good complimentary flavour for the rolls and balanced the spice in them. The last item we ordered was the pineapple chicken curry, which I think was ok. I know this is one of those dishes that people rave about, but I honestly didn't understand the hype here. Thought I've been here several Times previously, and thoroughly enjoyed my meals, this is the one time I wished I had ordered something else. The pineapple chunks were not sweet, they were kind of salty, and the curry wasn't very balanced in their spice profile. I was quite surprised, as this restaurant has always previously been 100% impressive for all of our dishes. However, the coconut rice was exactly as I remember, super fresh, and absolutely delicious! The service from start to finish was great, staff were knowledgeable, and when you asked for opinions of food choices, they didn't recommend the most expensive menu item, but did just speak to us about the entire list of appetizers (I wish they narrowed it down for us though). We can't wait to be back!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We had some take out from this place and my goodness were our tastebuds delighted! We tried mostly their vegetarian fare, which I was just so surprised as how good it was. The pad Thai I would go there just for this alone! The tofu was well marinated, and the flavours of the pad Thai were just so well infused with great spices and sauces, such a well made meal! The veggie mix was also well infused with flavour, and the tofu was nicely marinated before it was thrown into this dish. I can't really tell what the flavours were, but they all just worked well together. I can understand why more people are converting to being vegetarian, when food is so well made, I can't wait to go back here to try out the rest of this menu!","Sentiment":"positive"}

The pad see ew was very good with nice soy sauce flavour among other spices with a decent amount of vege and chicken.  But the pad Thai was the show stopper for me. It was AMAZING.

{"Review Text":"I read an article about how great this restaurant is, so I bookmarked it for a future visit. A few years forward and my friend said she was craving Thai food. So I made a reservation for Saturday dinner. The restaurant was small and fun! There were decorations all around. My boyfriend and I arrived before my friend did, so we checked-in at our reservation time and requested to be seated at the patio. The staff were friendly and helpful- they suggested a few popular items off the menu and kindly reminded us about the time limit for dining. While waiting, we ordered two drinks, Jas-mi-peach and Thai green tea. Both drinks were lightly sweet and refreshing! When my friend arrived, we ordered our mains: My boyfriend ordered Tom Yum with chicken and two Mii Pu (for takeout). My friend ordered Khao Soi with braised beef and I ordered the same one with veggies and tofu. The portion size was very generous- it could be shared between two people! Khao Soi was delicious, the noodles were lightly chewy, the broth was a bit spicy, the veggies and tofu pieces were well-cooked. My friend and boyfriend said they also enjoyed their meal. Due to the time limit to dine, we weren't able to enjoy eating and talking as much. Despite that, we had a good time. A few tips: - Make a reservation early! Time slots fill out fast. -There is a time limit for dining (), so read the menu and decide beforehand - The seating (outside and inside) are very tight- bring the least amount of belongings. If you're looking for an adventure for your tastebuds, this is a great spot!","Sentiment":"positive"}

The flavour on the chicken was mouth savouring and I would reorder that exact dish again! The pad thai was okay. The mango sticky rice for dessert was also spectacular visually and taste wise. The rice is warm so it isn't the typical cool and chilled dessert meal you would imagine. Interior was dimmed and pleasant for an evening night dinner. Give this spot a try!","Sentiment":"positive"}

But still even being a little hot for our taste they were really good.   The basil chicken is my gogo dish at Thai restaurants that I sue to test them out and they have nailed it here,  really delsicous dish,  wonderful flavours and balance.

Then on Friday, we came in for lunch. A young lady greeted us and led us to our table. She gave us the menu and brought two glasses of cold water. She gave us a few minutes, so that we can decide what to order. The place was decorated beautifully, the walls were covered with tropical-themed artworks. The lighting fixtures were cool and modern. On the menu, a lot of the items looked so good! I ordered Tom Yum Pad Thai (most popular item) with tofu. My friend ordered Famous Pad Thai with chicken. Each item came out hot and fresh! It was presented beautifully as well. I've never tried Tom Yum Pad Thai before, I didn't know what to expect. It was lightly spicy- the noodles were cooked to perfection, the vegetables were cooked well, and the roasted peanuts provided crunchiness to the meal. My friend said she enjoyed her Famous Pad Thai- it was delicious! During our meal, our friendly waitress came by a few times to check-in on us and to refill our water.

I had Classic Butter Chicken (basmati, mango chutney and poppadum). All were good! Donna, the owner, took very good care of us.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I haven't been to the Caledonian since January (my one and only time) and I was welcomed like it had been just last week since I'd been there. We sat at the bar and Beth took good care of us.  We ordered the mac and cheese and a Scottish egg and they were good. There were Scottish dancers which were very entertaining. What a nice place ... I'm going to make it a point of getting there more often.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"As a Scottish person living in the US this place felt like some home cooking. Got the haggis neeps and tatties, it was perfect.

{"Review Text":"Its got a proper pub feel and a nice back patio, creates the feeling of being in Scotland without getting on a plane. Went here to try the haggis and tastes just the way I remember from my last trip across the Atlantic. They've got Scottish beers like Tenants and Innis & Gunn plus an extensive whisky list. Main course portions were large. Tried a scotch egg for the first time and wasn't a big fan, but worth a try through the tasting platter. Would visit again.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"My friend invited me for a whisky tasting hosted by Tomintoul at this beautiful, cozy, and yet large pub on College St. Right when you walk in you get the feeling you're in the UK. Packed shoulder to shoulder, yet very welcoming. The front end seems small but they have seats in the back as well. The staff and clientele are very polite and friendly. Rosie, our bartender and server (we sat at the bar) was attentive and fun to talk to. I was recommended the haggis dinner. I've never had haggis before but had a preconception that it was pretty awful but this haggis changed my mind. Scotland's national dish of lamb, oats and spices on a bed of mashed turnip and potatoes. It was well seasoned and tasted delicious! The texture was of ground meat. Nothing binding it together, I don't think. Knife not required. The crisps on the top were welcomed to contrast the texture of the smooth mash. They do have vegetarian options here too. The tasting itself was wonderful. A representative from Tomintoul presented to us their : 10, 12, . He went through a brief history and process of making the whiskey in which we ended each segment with a nosing and tasting of each whiskey starting with the . His pacing was perfect and kept us interested. This was a perfect evening for me. Great food, great drink and great people. Would go back. In fact, I'll be there again next Tuesday. =)","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Extra bright star for the massive list of whisky that is available to choose from. You can find some strange ones that are not available on the market and try out some new ones that have always caught your eye. If you can't decide, there are whisky flights to choose from and they provide  an easy introduction to the different flavours. I came with friends on a weekend and sat in the open patio space in the back. The tables were spaced far apart, so it was comfortable and everyone could have their own private conversations. I had the steak pie with fries and shared the sticky toffee pudding over a glass of whiskey afterwards. Food was great, the steak pie was tender and stuck to the ribs. The sticky toffee pudding was amazing and a perfect match to the whiskey. Staff are friendly and always makes sure you have everything (another pint?) that you may need. A great place and will be back!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I google-searched for a restaurant in town which serves Sunday roasts and  The Caledonian was one of the few recommended.. I was there . So, two Sunday evenings ago ,my boyfriend and I decided to go there for dinner but when we arrived at , we were told they served the last roast beef dish at ... What a let down... .but that just went to prove how popular the dish is.. We decided to dine at the restaurant anyways and were seated by a pleasant host in the back, cozy patio. I asked for the Scotch egg appetizer right away since I remembered it being delicious.. It was tastier than before and the little salad that came on the same plate had a very nice, slightly sweet dressing on it.. As for my entree, I couldn't decide if I should go for the butter chicken because it is usually too sweet and creamy in the Indian restaurants I have had it at. Anyway, I thought I would try it and ...it has my vote for the best butter chicken in town!!  Chicken thighs were used, perhaps, but at least it was not breast meat which is served in most Indian restaurants. And it was the right spicyness .. Thumbs up  to the chef, James, who did such a wonderful job !My boyfriend had the steak pie which he enjoyed too. Our server was friendly and attentive and made our overall experience at the restaurant ,great! We will definitely be back for their Sunday roast ..and soon!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"My friend and I were down the street at an event and wanted to try something new in the vicinity. The Caledonian looked very promising with highly rated reviews and mouthwatering photos of their food. The waitress greeted us when we walked in and I thought maybe the reviews may have been wrong because there was hardly customers in the restaurant. Turns out there's another section at the back that opens up to a lovely patio. The customers out back seemed to be enjoying themselves and I retracted my first impression. Our waitress was very attentive and made sure to check on us every once in a while to make sure we were okay. Even another waitress would ask how we were. Such friendly staff is a bonus. I've only had a Scotch egg one other time at a carnival so I wasn't sure what to expect. The Scotch egg was delicious! It wasn't too salty and paired nicely with the salad. I'm not much of a salad eater. My fish and chips was decent. I have fond memories of fish and chips in the UK and this wasn't quite the same. The steak in my friend's steak pie was so flavourful and tender. A lot of the time I've had dry and not tasty meat in pies such as this. When it came time to pay I reached inside my backpack for my wallet and found that the lid on my container of cherries had popped off. There were mushed cherries at the bottom of my backpack, it was quite gross. The waitress saw the displeasure on my face and when I asked for a couple of napkins she offered to wet a couple for me. What service! She even got me a ziplock bag so that my cherries would not create more of a mess for me. The service was impeccable and sitting at the back enjoying the atmosphere was lovely. I'm sure I'll be back to try something else on the menu.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"What an incredible dining experience! Food: Venison Tartare- This was such a delicate dish; Savory but fresh at the same time. I actually was not a fan of the rye cracker; it was far too hard. 5\/- What a heavenly dish! The flavor profile was more towards the truffle rather than the bolognese, but absolutely decadent. I could eat this everyday!!! 5\/- This was a smaller cut of salmon but absolutely to die for. Every element of this dish worked in the most harmonious way. 5\/- This was a delicious desert for the first , but was a bit too powerful and somewhat bitter for me. The smokiness definitely comes through and is potent. 3\/- This was an interesting flavor profile; one that I have not had experienced before. Surprisingly delicious and mild in flavor. 4.5\/: Earl of Montenegro: Somewhat bland and disappointing actually 3\/- A very good manhattan; I really enjoyed the tobacco bitters 5\/'Orange- This was a good drink, nothing to rave about. 4\/: We sat at the bar- Service was fantastic. Food came out promptly and I was not left without a drink for more than a few minutes. Everyone was very friendly and courteous. 5\/: Very relaxed environment, with smaller and bigger groups. It's a small venue but they definitely make it work. It got a little loud at times, but that just depends on the tables and the clientele at any given point in time. 5\/5","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The venue is well decorated but pretty tiny so recommend making a reservation online as it could fill up rather quickly. This place specializes in game meats and I was initially teetering between the bison ribeye or the wild boar steak and was wondering which one would be more gamey. The waitress was very helpful in my decision and I'm happy to report that I didn't taste any gamey-ness at all in the ribeye. Everything in that dish melded together very well. From the tenderness of the bison ribeye to the flavorful polenta and plentiful kale\/rapini mixture, I found myself wanting more and more after each bite. It was just done, really really well. My partner had the confit duck leg and that was a treat as well. The duck was also very flavorful and tasty. The only thing that threw us off was there was hint of horseradish in the butternut squash puree that kind of ruined the flavor of the risotto for us. We would get flavors of good and savory and then random bouts of horseradish that just did not mesh well. Aside from the mains, I also got the duck heart yakitori appetizer and that was unfortunately a miss for me. That was the only thing that lacked flavor for me. Could have used some salt? Other than that, can definitely attest that it was worth the money and would come back.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Will definitely go back next time we are in town.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Sending a bill to Doug Ford for an open keg which they can't use due to flip flopping of covid rules, the chef cooking meat in front of vegan protesters...

Inside it was also on the smaller side, cozy. Service: () Good service, working with you to find cocktails you like. Drinks: Duck a L'orange (): the best cocktail I tried here. Very smooth with an undertone of vanilla. Made with duck fat. We tried smoked barrel () and lady marmalade() as well. They were good, but cannot compare to Duck a L'orange. Food: ANTLER TRUFFLE BRIE - () It was good, but nothing amazing DUCK HEART YAKITORI () - the duck hearts were just ok, but the sauce and the scallions were outstanding. BISON RIB EYE (4.) - very well cooked, the mushrooms were amazing. ONTARIO VENISON LOIN () - a bit salty, but otherwise very pleasant. Deserts: MAPLE TART () - would order it again STRAWBERRY SEMIFREDDO () - almost a pallet cleanser. SMOKED CHOCOLATE MOUSSE () - comes with a smoke bowl on top, a heavy desert, great for sharing.  Desert comes with a presentation. Next time I would go for Duck a L'orange drink and the burger.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Amazing portions and really tasty . The mushrooms \/ sauce on the bison steak are so tasty . My only minor gripe is the bison steak is quite chewy if medium rare. Although they recommend medium rare ; I'd advise getting medium for the bison steak . I had a hard time cutting the steak at medium rare. Also if you get the bison steak make sure you're hungry ; it's really filling (not complaining about that ; happy to be full :) ) Also friendly and accommodating staff ; I asked for them to cook my steak further ; not only did they do that but they also gave me an extra serving of mushrooms ! Awesome job on their part :) .","Sentiment":"positive"}

We had tartare, smoked cabbage salad, bison ribeye, and a fish dish with lentils (forgetting which fish off the top of my head.) Everything was great. The bison ribeye was worth all $. I'll be looking forward to getting that again for next time. They were even so sweet about my rapini intolerance (rip, I will miss you sweet delicious rapini.) AND THE FEATURE DESSERT!!! It was clementine cheesecake. It was light delicious, and fresh. It tasted like pure clementine, we even watched another table taste it to see how they'd react, and they were also delighted. Excited to come back, the wine was great and so were the cocktails. This place rules!!!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This time, I came back a second time with a reservation on a weekend night. I highly recommend doing reservations a week or at least a few days in advance if you're planning to do a weekend night. Pizza Oro: Good portions of toppings and the pizza sauce were delicious. The pizza was thin but wasn't too soggy with the toppings. Rigatoni al Funghi: The sauce was good, lots of flavour with the white truffle sauce. Great option if you're already a fan of rigatoni. Calamari Fritti: Different breading they use for the calamari, which was still crispy yet light which is a nice change from other places. The portions were decent to share with a group of friends. The service was good despite being a busy weekend night. Only downside that the seating is a bit tight that you might likely end up being near the door, but besides that, it's totally worth coming. My new favourite spots for Italian food in the Downtown area.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Cafe Oro di Napoli is a popular downtown east-side spot for Italian food. I was pretty excited to try out this spot after hearing rave reviews about this place. I came on a weekend night so it was pretty busy, highly recommend getting a reservation beforehand. Since I came with no reservation, I ended up eating at the bar side which was still okay but definitely more ideal to book reservations in advance if you're coming with a group. Tonnarelli: Deliciously creamy and was the perfect amount of flavour. The flavour was quite rich that other additional toppings weren't needed. Pappardelle: Great pasta noodles and nice tomato sauce. It was quite delicious and loved how much flavour there was. It's a great spot for delicious pasta at a reasonable price point. I really liked how both kinds of pastas weren't overwhelming and still filled with flavour. The place is a bit on the small side and tight on seating so reservations are necessary, I got lucky that there were some spots to still sit at the bar seats. Overall, great service and would return to try out more dishes, especially the pizza!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Came in for a late lunch \/ early dinner. Alcohol portions are pretty big, this was unexpected. Arancini we're not warm all the way through, cold in the centre - never experienced something like this at any other restaurant I've been to. The sauce with Arancini is good, but come on... Food needs to be cooked (or at least microwaved) properly. We got the prosciutto pizza and didn't expect to get a soggy piece of dough with cold toppings on top - very strange that the dough is warm and everything else on the pizza is cold like it came from a fridge. The waitress was quiet and awkward. Place looks simple and nice, but it didn't live up to all of its reviews with the cold food. Won't be back.","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Make sure you get a reservation - this place gets busy! Came by for dinner on a Sunday night and got the following: - Arancini di Asparagi - Penne Gamberi - forget the name, but their daily pizza special similar which was like a carbonara pizza Everything was fresh and came out piping hot. My favourite was the pasta with the rose sauce and large juicy shrimps, which I wish there was more of. The pizza, while not soggy was a bit tough but enjoyable nonetheless. The staff were super friendly and made sure to explain everything as we ordered and got the food. We got a gelato at the end which was a nice ending to a wonderful meal.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Dropped by on a Sunday evening and it was super busy, would recommend booking a reservation for this restaurant. The seating area of the restaurant was rather limited but had a good view of the open kitchen. Food came fast, service was okay. Barbabitole - Was heavy, but delicious. There was a generous amount of buffalo ricotta which was super fatty and rich. Candied beats and vincotta was delicious as it offset the ricotta fattiness. Pistachio was a good touch as it added a crunch to the cheese and cooked beats. Delicious, would recommend! Pizza Oro - A thin crust pizza with a lot of toppings: , garlic, basil, cheese. The contents of the pizza was only okay, if felt like too many things happening at once. Or the sausages don't have much flavor or the ingredients was not spread out well. The dough was a bit disappointing. The crust was too dry and burnt for my taste. The bottom of the pizza was cooked, but I would have expected a bit more toasted. Based on this pizza experience, I'd order a pasta next time.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Loved it. - Cozze: Ok sized mussels (and lots of them), really tasty tomato sauce. Service was super friendly and spot-on with suggestions. Price is fair.

The calamari was crispy and light, the batter was nothing I've had before. It didn't feel too greasy, yet still crispy. The pizza had a good char on the bottom from being fired in the wood oven I presume, it was thin but had ample toppings. The pasta was the favourite! The pasta was perfectly al dente, it had such a rich and deep mushroom flavour, all the while not being too heavy with the cream. The prices are also very reasonable, hard to find a great entree for about $!","Sentiment":"positive"}

The inside was surprisingly super nice, clean, and more upscale than we thought it would have been for a fast casual place. We got the taco supreme, carne asada and the cochinita pibil tacos. Our favourite was definitely the carne asada; the meat was cooked pretty well and the addition of the crispy onions on top made it even better. We were disappointed with the other two tacos but they were still decent at their price point. The star of this place is definitely the self serve salsa bar and hot sauce bar with so so many different options to choose from! My favourite is the pineapple salsa :)","Sentiment":"positive"}

Both were absolutely flavorful and fresh! The chips were so crunchy and fresh too! The queso was so creamy and perfectly spicy (beware if you're sensitive to heat because it has a bite).

And so did a lot of people. The staff were friendly, got us seated as soon as tables became available, and checked for vaxx info. We got a couple of beers and some dinner. The menu is pretty comprehensive, I don't think you can really go wrong with anything. I highly recommend the steak and wild mushroom pie. It's the perfect meal on a cold winter night.

We got the Merguez Shakshouks and the Landwer's Famous Schnitzel. It was my first time trying Mediterranean food, so I didn't really know what to expect. The Merguez Shakshouks basically comes with a big piece of bread and you're supposed to tip pieces off and dip it in the soup it comes with. The soup has a lot of toppings so that helped make it more filling. The Landwer's Famous Schnitzel was cool too, but is a very plain and simple dish since it's basically just a crispy breaded chicken breast with your choice of side. I'd recommend this place for the experience! It seems like a popular place that many tourists probably visit since it's right next to a hotel.

{"Review Text":"This food at this place in incredible. I don't think you can go wrong with any of it. We got: 1. Agadashi Tofu (5\/5) - topped with a sort of kimchi 2. Volcano roll (5\/5) 3. Lobster roll (4\/5) - I only docked a point because each piece was massive and had to be eaten in two bites. 4. Bulgogi taco (5\/5) - this one was lovely - so flavorful 5. Soft shell crab taco (5\/5) - also lovely with a nice crunch 6. Oreo churro (3\/5) - as an Oreo and dessert lover I didn't love this one. I found it a bit dry but others said they would come back just for this so maybe make your own mind up here! The lobster and crab dishes are only available at their dinner service. The bathrooms are downstairs and the path and stairs are super slippery so take care (or pee before coming if you don't want to risk it!). We will be back - great food!","Sentiment":"positive"}

I tried three different tacos: bulgogi, teriyaki chicken and Baja fish. The bulgogi one was by far my favourite! I really wanted to try the soft shell crab taco but it wasn't available.

{"Review Text":"Who doesn't love an affordable and delicious lunch special ?  The Haam had an amazing deal for only $, , !  You can literally get the best of both worlds: Mexican and Japanese food. My friend and I both got the same set and split our tacos and rolls. The gyoza was a nice little appetizer . We got the Baja fish tacos and the gochujang Barbados beef tacos to share. The fish was really crispy and the pickles were a nice pairing. The beef taco had a hard shell and the shell was a little too oily, but the marinated beef was really delicious. The sushi pieces were the perfect size and the fish were fresh as well . 10\/'re around the area. It is definitely a bang for your buck. The service at the Haam was excellent as well. The staffs were attentive and nice. The restaurant also had really nice decor with cute neon light quotes on the wall as well.","Sentiment":"positive"}

This platter including the extra Oshi pressed sushi salmon roll we got was $! This meal lasted us for three meals ! Definitely worth the price with the amount of food we got. Just a reminder that we called in to the Haam for the order and picked it up as it's not on the menu on any food apps and you get 15% off too! I would say the Tacos were definitely the highlight of the platter. The hard taco shell was a little soft though because of the deliver and also the soft taco did fall apart easily but I would say the tacos still taste amazing ! The torched sushi was very good as how I remembered it at the restaurant. Overall I highly recommend the haam still if you want takeout tacos and sushi combinations","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"The location is small and cozy. I love that they have so many fusion food! We got to try both tacos and sushi! The pressed sushi was really a delicacy and the fish really melted in our mouths! The crispy taco is better than the soft tacos. We also had the soft shell carne Asada but i found that the pickled red chilies were a tad bit too spicy and overpowering. The crispy taco had creme which balanced the spicy chorizo. Overall, it was a good experience! A little bit on the expensive side for sushi but definitely a good fusion location!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I visited The Haam during Summerlicious ($) and it was well worth the drive downtown. It was a three course meal, with an app, a main of two tacos and your choice of sushi roll, and dessert. It was A LOT of food for the price! It's a pretty small place so sometimes you'll have to wait to be seated. I chose to have the tuna ceviche and it was a great start. Tangy and well portioned. I also had a try of all the other apps (each person ordered a different one in my friend group) and my favourite was actually the pineapple salsa as it was a unique flavour. For my tacos, I chose to upgrade ($) to the crab claw option (but unfortunately I can't remember the name of the roll I chose). The tacos were packed, flavourful, and really filling. And the sushi was well made and really good as well. I went with the oreo churros for dessert. They were really sweet, especially when you dip them in the sauce they have - I could only eat two of the four. Overall, the Summerlicious menu was such a good deal. I think this place is worth a visit even without the special menu, and I'd definitely come back to try some of their other tacos and rolls.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Whoa this place is popular! Went on a drizzly Friday evening and it was a non-stop stream of people (service was quick so turnover of tables was good for this type of place). The Haam definitely has a \"happening\" atmosphere to it. Now on to the food. We got: - Guacamole: Smooth and creamy. I liked the bit of bite from the jalapeno. The side tortilla chips were standard. - Tacos: Now this is where Haam really shines! Got the soft shell crab, bulgogi and shrimp tacos, and all of them were really tasty, had strong flavours, and a firm taco shell. My favourite was the bulgogi (perfect sweet\/tangy balance). - Geso Karaage: The squid legs were overly deep fried (tasted almost slightly burnt). - Ladybug Roll: Good size and protein-to-rice ratio. Would have liked more sear on the tuna and less of the poblano cream though. The space, while tight, had a great energetic vibe. Service was efficient. Prices were reasonable. Overall, an enjoyable Friday night meal.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Our first visit in . The environment was such a cool novelty and there was so much to look at and so many shots. I had done the D20 shots and had a couple cocktails, I got the dungeon burger and everything was amazing. But now in 2023, we went for a birthday party. We were super excited because of how great of a time we had before. Our server Ethan was super nice and patient with our party of almost 20. The room was rented out. The music they had playing sounded like a 90s breakup playlist, that was the first issue of the night. Because we had rented a room, we thought we could have our own music. After the host, Ethan and the manager went back and forth, we managed to access Spotify on the TV and they turned off room's music, we were free to listen to Meghan Thee Stallion. We got our drinks and apps, it was staggered as people were arriving. My wife loved the princess peach. I really liked the bananas in pajamas, had I not the been the DD I would've had another. And honestly I had to drive , I could've, but oh well. We got our Frank's red hot tater tots. It was like a salt mix the tater tots were in. I hadn't had that in 2019, but I probably could've ordered . It was great 10\/. As the night progressed, I want to have a moment of silence for Ethan. He endured SO much. Ok moment over. I got a cappuccino which was great, but I couldn't find sugar and had to endure it without. I'm sure that's how adults drink them normally. We got Chicken Tendies and the Dungeon Burger. Here's where we had issues. The Tendies were dry, not juicy, just dry chicken encased in bland, boring crumbs. The fries were stale and old tasting. Not crispy and delicious. The dungeon burger was amazing years back. So I ordered it with as much as I could get. I spent almost $. But did I get them? No. No I did not. I got minimal bacon, cheese, mushrooms, caramelized onions and jaleps. It was $. Now the bun. I think as someone who's tried every restaurant gluten free bun and every one I can find in stores. I'm just confused. There's at LEAST 't taste like a cardboard brick. Yet EVERY restaurant seems to carry the disgusting ones. I don't get it. Same idea for pasta. All in all 3\/, drinks and apps. But the mains just fell short of novelty and quality, I wouldn't go back. The burger was a scam imo and price wise it was all quite expensive.","Sentiment":"positive"}

While we only went for drinks, the food menu looked great and the food we saw on other tables looked delicious. If I hadn't just had dinner, I would have definitely eaten there. We went on a Friday the 13th in October so we were expecting a bit of a wait but we're pleasantly surprised by how little time it took to get a text that our table was ready. There's a little waiting room off to the side of the entrance fully decorated with geeky, spooky stuff! Reading the menu is the best part in my opinion. It's so fun to see the ways they tie in nerdy jokes and themes. Our server was really knowledgeable and nice! We did the classic D20 roll for a shot and then ordered a couple cocktails after. Overall, it was an amazing experience and I'm so excited to return to try the full menu.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Recently had the pleasure of dining at Storm Crow Manor, and it was an absolute delight! This place offers a unique experience that combines fantastic food, a nerdy atmosphere, and a ton of fun activities. First off, the food was outstanding. I tried the \"Sugar & Spice's Chicken Bites Extravaganza,\" \"Chi-Chi's Chicken Bowl,\" and \"Lon Lon Rancheros,\" and each dish was a flavorful masterpiece. The chicken bites were crispy, perfectly seasoned, and oh-so-tasty. The Chicken Bowl was a hearty, savory delight, and the Lon Lon Rancheros had just the right amount of spice to satisfy my taste buds. The menu here is a haven for geeks and foodies alike. But the fun doesn't stop at the food. Storm Crow Manor provides an immersive and exciting atmosphere for anyone who enjoys gaming and nerdy culture. I had an absolute blast playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends in their themed game rooms. The attention to detail in the decor and the overall ambiance adds a layer of magic to the experience. Now, let's talk drinks. Storm Crow Manor has an impressive selection of shots and beers. Whether you're into classic options or something a bit more adventurous, their drink menu has something for everyone. I couldn't resist trying a few unique shots, and they were a hit with my group.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"For a restaurant that's marketed as essentially something of a gimmick, the food here is surprisingly good! My soba noodles came in an enormous bowl full of various ingredients including carrots, onions, and peanuts - mixed with an absolutely delicious sesame sauce. Not the most traditional combination, but it worked quite nicely for both flavour and texture. My only complaint is that the avocado - ordered as an add-on - was not the freshest... My friend's pizza was very much enjoyed, with a fluffy, thick crust and tons of cheese. However, the side of poutine disappointed a bit as the lack of sufficient gravy made the fries rather dry. The food nevertheless exceeded our expectations - a satisfactory meal overall. We went for lunch this time, so it might be worth a return visit for the night ambience and cocktails. The service was excellent. All of the staff were super friendly and attentive. We never had to wait around for anything. Water was (mostly) consistently refilled, everything came promptly, the waiter accommodated our requests and was knowledgeable about the menu. There's a real sense of welcome here. The most impressive part was, of course, the interior and the decorations and games making this restaurant a one-of-a-kind: a fun and cool experience for all my fellow nerds (any Dungeons & Dragons players here?). Enough said: check out the copious number of pictures, or go to see for yourself!","Sentiment":"positive"}

Food: - Pop Rockin' - one of my favorite rolls, the experience of having watermelon pop rocks embedded in your roll takes you in for a surprise. A play on your taste buds and a unique dining experience~ within your food. What a unique concept that worked so well with the flavors. - lychee martini- according to the server it's known For their martinis -tuna\/mushroom pizza - honestly 5\/. The truffle oil, and the crunch, flaky, crust on the bottle is so simple yet so so buttery and yummy. The tuna side is fresh, just the right amount and doesn't over power the pizza crust. Mmmm. -black cod, miso- flaky fish, pretty good, flavourful, umami. So good! - bulgogi beef tacos - small x3, was not a huge fan of it, found it a little toooo sweet, and the sauce was quite over powering.. If you're a fan of saucy, sweet bulgogi, order, but probably won't be recommending in the future. - wagyu beef fried rice - generous portion to split, with little chunks of beef. Savory, and a great compliment to the side dishes. Service: kind and friendly. Attentive to water (never had my water empty). Clean place mat every time we sat waiting in between entrees.

{"Review Text":"I visited here for our anniversary dinner in June, and it's been a pleasurable experience. We had the Chef's special tasting menu of 5-courses, which I find a better value than ordering a la carte. However, your whole party has to choose it. It's more of a surprise and delight because you will not know what you'll get each course until it's served. We were a little hesitant at first but do not regret it one bit at the end. The fun part is that you and your partner would get something different, so you can taste  $400~ including tax and tip (including a glass of wine, bread)! The menu rotates weekly and there a la carte options as well, the selection is not huge on their menu but each dish was tasty. You can tell the server what you don't want. For us is no rabbit, and they ensured we wouldn't have that in our courses. It shows the talent of the Chef in adapting to our preferences. Atmosphere is rustic and romantic with dim lights and there's even an outdoor courtyard you can dine at during the summer.

Third was the main course, our party received venison, ribeye, and halibut for the meat of our main, then comes cheese, and finally dessert. My first course was a hamachi dish (type of tuna) served with roasted carrots. This was served raw, but nevertheless it was delicious.

{"Review Text":"It's been almost five years since last time I tried this restaurant and had the impression that the cooking here was quite old-school style and solid. We decided to try it again for my birthday. The food here was so good. The four of us (including one toddler) ordered a few items to share from their a la carte menu. They also offered tasting menu options at this restaurant with 5, 7, . We ordered a basket of bread (with a few varieties) for sharing before appetizers were served. It was gone so quickly. My boy ate so much. They also provided each of us a spoon of tasteful vegetable. Now the food we ordered: - Wagyu was sooooo yummy. Very soft and tender. Melted in my mouth immediately. - Tuna tartare: I could hardly figure out it was tuna tartare by just looking at the dish. The tuna was wrapped in a layer of crispy filling, which looked more like a crab cake. It was so perfectly flavoured. A dish full of creativity and surprise. - Scallop: topped with some leafy vegetable salad. Yummy as usual. - Gnocchi and halibut were good too, although not the best I've ever had. - Beef ribeye: impressive dish again. They have really good cut for the beef here. - Cow's Cheese platter with pears: I can never say no to cheese, especially when they were paired with refreshing pears. - Chocolate Basque cake: Good but not wowing. Overall, there was no dish that was not good here. The most impressive dishes were the beef, the tuna tartare and the wagyu. The service was okay too but not meeting Michelin standard yet. Maybe that's why they didn't get one star, but I'll give them one if I can! I can imagine this restaurant to be my top recommendation place for special event.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I want to be very clear. The food was outstanding. Truly. But what took place this past Saturday was a combination of restaurant greed, a server potentially protecting their table, a lack of communication, and a lack of timing with respect to coordination between the kitchen and sommelier. It was my 52nd birthday, that was indicated in our reservation. We were escorted to the back of the restaurant in what was clearly 'overflow' tables. Poorly located and seemed like an after thought. I literally had the back of a woman head to my right. It was just as unfortunate for her as it was for me. We had asked to be moved to what was an empty table. The server inquired and we were told it was a full house and they could not move us. Despite the reservation having been made months the advance, we chose to leave. My partner, being the more diplomatic of the two of us, spoke to the hostess. The hostess indicated to my partner that they were looking for another table. Our server did not. Either they were and our server intentionally didn't communicate that to us to save his table or it was only in our choice to leave that they reacted and found a solution. Further, the restaurants ability to sync between the food appearing at our table and the sommelier serving us our wine pairing was just poor. We were either left with food and waiting for wine or with wine waiting for food. If you're going spend over a thousand dollars for dinner, go to Canoe.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"You'll pay a pretty penny for the meal, where an appetizer papad ki tokri, essentially an assortment of papadams and chutneys will cost $16. It's a dish that's sometimes given away freely at other places. At Adrak they provide three different crispy crackers to dip into finely chopped salsa, a spiced beet dip, and a fruity chutney. It's something that arrives quickly to keep diners placated and awaken the taste buds. Unlike my experience at their Richmond Hill counterpart, Adrak Yorkville doesn't shy away from spice. The batter of their onion bhajia ($16) is a cacophony of flavours with different spices coming through as you bite through the crispy onion fritter ending with a heat that lingers on the tongue. The mint chutney doesn't calm down the sting at all but acts as a delicious condiment for other dishes as well. Such as the thecha paneer tikka ($22), an interesting creation where two discs of soft Indian cheese are tossed with spices, roasted, and filled with finely chopped nuts, creating a delicate bite with a bit of texture. While there is a smear of curry and green chili sauce topping the paneer, I found the mint chutney (from the bhadjia) adds a bright refreshing element that makes it even better. For a more traditional take on paneer, the paneer khurchan ($28) keeps the cheese in large chunks so it's soft within the savoury tomato sauce. It's great for tucking into a piece of the garlic naan ($; ) that's so fluffy with lightly blistered crispy edges. Adrak's pork vindaloo ($38) uses a unique preparation, slices of pork tenderloin that's pan fried and drizzled with the slightly vinegary spicy sauce, rather than being braised in the vindaloo. So, while this dish is listed under the \"curries\" umbrella of the menu, it's not saucy. Consequently, something our waiter pointed out when we tried to order the naan, \"But, what are you going to eat this with?\" Um... the vindaloo and paneer khurchan, we pointed out. Which is when the final characteristic of the Yorkville handbook came out - a helpful but sometimes snooty feeling air. Apparently, those two dishes would not be enough to warrant ordering naan. He then suggested a full explanation of the menu before we order. Truthfully, I was taken aback from his response, there were already so many titles and descriptions of the menu that surely it should be self explanatory? No, it's not. Yet, with some simple changes, it could work. For example, the \"Adrak Signatures\" dishes are not the typical chef recommendations, rather just more expensive and interesting takes on their appetizers. My suggestion: just call the section \"Adrak Signature Starters\" and the confusion is solved. And if the pork vindaloo is not a curry than move it to another section. In the end, this exchange with their staff irked me. Sure, he was probably trying to be helpful and make sure we were aware of Adrak's special take on dishes, but there was almost a condescending tone that came through - let me explain and order for you because you obviously you don't know what you're doing is how I felt the exchange transpired. This is a long review, head to Gastroworld for the rest.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This was my first visit to Adrak. Hands down one of the best Indian cuisine fine dine experience in the city. It's a busy place so you need prior reservation. One those places where I would love to dress up well :) My most favorite was the mocktail Joker. Nice elegant fruity flavors with a kick of lemon. For starters I had the soya chap which was absolutely well cooked. Main course was Paneer kuchran with garlic naan. Asparagus kofta was a delight for the tastebuds. Amazing service and the server was polite and interactive. He was helping the people next table with the right choices for non Indian guests and did his job quite well. Will surely visit again. They do have cancellation charges so plan your guest list well in advance.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"If you're looking for something upscale in Indian dinning this place is for you We went here mainly for drinks and apps and we were not disappointed! Got basically every drink on the cocktail menu which were all based on different places in india. Every single one was delicious and some even included a cool experience such a smoke filled cup or a bubble on top of the drink. We then went for the Rani kachori which is a puffed ball stuffed with yogurt lentils beans and other items! This was delicious as well, the beet yogurt had a great sweet and tangy taste and it paired so well with all the other toppings inside. Reminded me of what we make at home Service was on point, and the decor of this restaurant was my absolute favourite. Felt like we were in this old school restaurant that was designed accordingly. This place has only been open 's fully booked already!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Another day another catfish restaurant. We saw various pages (Ex. BlogTO) post about this elevated Indian restaurant so you best know we paid them a visit. The entrance and interior were absolutely stunning. The smells walking in were so fragrant and aromatic. We ordered: Hara Salaad: This salad was pretty good. It was light but had flavor Pista lamb chops: These were apparently one of their signatures. However i found it to taste salty and not much else Pork Vindaloo: This was so underwhelming. It was listed under \"Curries\" but was just seared meat on a thin bed of sauce. Within the first bite you could really taste how dry and tough the pork was Dak Bungalow Matan curry: We sent back the Pork Vindaloo and substituted for spicy lamb curry. The lamb was pretty tough and the flavours straight up tasted like ragu Murgh Makhani: AKA Butter Chicken curry. Even though the presentation was nice, the flavors were off. It was very tomato-y and the flavors weren't rich or deep. Prawn Tandoori: This was my favorite item of the night. The prawns were big, plump and full of flavor Butter naan: Basic and nothing special Garlic naan: This was aromatic and had more flavor Their serving style and etiquette, was definitely not up to par with upscale dining. At a higher end restaurant, you would expect the staff to speak english but it was really difficult to communicate with all the wait staff Our server also kept trying to push  \"signature\" lamb dishes and a lobster dish. Even though we asked for recommendations of anything other than those. It seemed like the management told him to push those items as they were the most expensive items on the menu, but he didn't explain how anything tasted like. After our appetizers, we sat there for far too long before getting the attention of any staff to clear our plates and bring our mains, even though many service staff walked by. I would definitely skip and go to those no-frills Indian restaurants with purely authentic food.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This place is in the neighborhood so when their signs went up I was looking forward to a visit. High end for this type of cuisine is almost non existent in the city with a few failed attempt here and there which are nothing to write home about. Sadly this place hasn't changed that scene. The setup is very nice with almost no expense spared on the interior and server ware. A very pleasant setup. Now comes the downer the service is all over the place starting with the reservations. I had booked several weeks in advance but no spots were available except the bar area and not at a decent hour at that. I had a slight change in plans and ended up cancelling the first reservation. When things got sorted out and I looked again for the same date lo and behold a bunch of desirable times opened up (bar area only again) thinking they are busy I said ok no big deal. When I walked there were scores on empty tables and after a bit of chat we were given the table seating. What gives? there is a whopping $$ fee for less than . Why hold back seats for paying patrons. Then came the table service with no one checking in after sitting down for a while to hovering on the tail end of the service. Need a bit of training here to sort this out. On to the food we ordered two sample platters Non vegetarian (grilled meat items) and milli juli chat I thought the grilled meats were ok with some items spiced for western palate. The sides of condiments being decent. One could ask for a higher spice level I suppose as this city has diverse enough demographics that exposure to various food styles is expected. Milli juli chat (apps) were just mediocre IMO. Just bland IMO with hardly any hint of spice that makes or breaks these appetizers. The amuse bouche potato cracker was ok. I enjoyed my Chimay blue as I feel it goes well with these spices. There is an extensive list of cocktails with visual appeal and tastes that might appeal. Avante Garde cuisine this place is not however if you want to impress someone with the setup (read Instagram, TikTok or whatever is trendy in the social media) and folks who have western palate by all means do visit. I would even suggest coming here for the drinks instead of the food.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I'll start by saying the food was very good. We ordered lamb biryani and butter chicken which were both delicious. I will admit that my friends and I did not do our due diligence before booking, as we mostly only wanted good food. We came in dressed perhaps a bit down, but not significantly so as we all wore dresses and were made up to a decent degree. We were younger than the other customers in the restaurant, but we are all clearly in our early twenties. When we walked in we were impressed by the decor, however our experience beyond that and the food did not hold up. The wait staff gave us rude looks and treated us like we were dumb from the beginning. Our waiter insisted on \"explaining\" the menu to us by simply reading the headers out loud to us (telling us what appetizers are, and that the platters would be good to share - although when we tried to order a platter the waiter told us it is only one serving and that we definitely would not be able share it which makes little sense). While we waited for the food, multiple members of the staff glared at us from various angles while whispering to each other. It was suffocating and we did not feel comfortable talking at all. Once our food arrived the same waiters returned to us every other minute asking how we liked the food in a condescending manner (including less than ). The rude stares continued. Though we were interested in dessert, we did not feel comfortable staying there any longer given the hostile environment. After telling the staff that we would not be getting dessert, we watched the waiters gossip with each other for at least two minutes over why we weren't ordering dessert before finally bringing us our bill. Upon leaving I gave them a tipped them as I normally would have but wrote on the receipt that they should stop judging customers, to which they later called me several times throughout the remaining few hours and left me multiple messages both on my number and my WhatsApp account as I did not have the time to immediately respond. If it continues I will consider it harassment. I definitely wish I could say better as I would have returned for the food, but unfortunately this is not the case.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"My recent dining experience at Madrina Tapas in Distillery was an intriguing blend of highs and lows, ultimately leaving a positive impression. The overall experience was good, marked by an adventurous exploration of tapas flavors. The portions were generous, allowing us to savor a variety of dishes without feeling overwhelmed. The taste was commendable, each dish reflecting the authenticity and creativity that Madrina Tapas is known for. However, our seating arrangement was a bit of a letdown. The high chair table was perhaps the worst choice for comfort. The elevated seating felt awkward, and the table proved too small to comfortably accommodate the array of dishes we ordered. This, unfortunately, impacted the overall enjoyment of the meal.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The croquetas were nice and crunchy, while the tortilla was a bit creamy in the middle. Service was great, but it was a little slow maybe because I was solo. I had to flag down my server twice, but I wasn't in a rush so it wasn't a huge deal.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Was happy to get a reservation here rather last minute  and experience their tasting menu. The decor in this place is awesome -- clearly a lot of thought went into the pieces here. I thought the loud house music clashed with the vibe, maybe trying a little hard to be hip when the interior is already impressive. From the tasting menu, here's what we had ordered from our favorite to least favorite: - avocado gazpacho - tuna tartare cone - eggplant and zucchini chips - iberico ham croqueta - flan de queso y fresa - coca flatbread with escalivada - arroz negro con pulpo - patatas bravas - gilda se salmon - oysters with salsa aperitivo Many of these dishes could be improved with another hit of salt at the end. I felt a lot of these were under seasoned, especially the squid ink paella, which you'd expect to be bursting with flavor, which was bland. The weakest was definitely the oysters, and coming from an oyster fiend that says a lot. You could barely taste the oyster itself with the salsa and the shoestring bits made it really awkward to eat. Avocado gaspacho on the other hand had us off to a really strong start -- may not have topped that honestly. The first three courses were super strong and it was kind of a bumpy road from there. I'd go again and maybe sit outside on a nice day. As cool as the decor is in there I think I'd prefer it to be a bit less congested and loud during my meal.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I was expecting the PATATAS BRAVAS MADRINA LIKE A MILLEFEUILLE to be crispier\/more wafer-esque, but it was nevertheless delicious with the sauces. The GRILLED GARROTXA CHEESE packed a punch and was good to try, though it was not mind-blowing in any capacity.

{"Review Text":"Dinner here took nearly . Not because we were sitting enjoying good conversation but that's how long it took to get our food with some people in my group getting their meals . La Palette was recommended to me, so I took a chance and brought out of town guests here and was absolutely embarrassed by the poor service. Made a reservation for 12. One person in the group was late (out of my control) and the server refused to take our order even for appetizers until they arrived . So . Appetizers and small plates slowly came out over the course of an hour. Anyone without food had to make do with the complimentary bread which was quickly devoured. Our server was barely around for us to ask about following up on orders. For example, a Charcuterie board took . How is that possible when its a small board of cured meat and some pickles. I'd like to say the food was probably good as other diners have noted. I enjoyed the Foie Gras and Fondant Fromage the most. Sad to say my friend who ordered a steak got it cold with cold fries as if it had been sitting up at the pass for a while. On their website they note that this isn't the place for you if you are in a rush for service. I thought that meant they were just a chill place, not that you'd be entirely ignored. We weren't even rude at all. If we were demanding it's because we were forced to be demanding just for basic service. If you see the rest of my review history I'm not a stickler for service, and am very generous overall with my ratings. I noticed the other large group next to us under a different server was being served regularly and having a great time. They were all dressed in suits. I can't verify this claim but it felt like they discriminated us based on our attire and overall ages. I'm fine to take my money elsewhere since it felt like LA Palette doesn't want someone like me there anyways.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"4.25\/'s birthday dinner on a Monday evening. We were promptly seated and the first thing we noticed was the open concept kitchen where the kitchen was in the middle of the rectangular restaurant. So as we were walking towards the reserved tables (I'm assuming all the tables in the back were reserved), we passed by the kitchen, which we thought was quite neat. I love it when restahrants don't have a lot of items on the menu, and have special dishes that they change from time to time. So I was excited to try this place out. Escargot $\/. The fried garlic was also a nice touch as well. We just wished it was shelled as we love the process of getting it out of the shell so you can get the most amount of meat out. We just felt like there wasn't a lot of meat per escargot. Horse tartare $\/. Would get again but maybe as another main instead of an app. Foie Gras $.5\/, spreading the flavor all around your mouth. Excellent. Duck Confit $\/. My partner enjoyed it a lot but I found the Spatzle (the pasta looking thing on the plate) to be a bit mushy and out of place with the duck. The duck was a bit dry and a bit too salty in my opinion. Steak $.5\/. The fries were nicely cooked as well. Chocolate ganache $\/. Not the best but pretty good. I loved it but it seemed like it was too much for my partner. Cardamom\/Saffron sponge cake $\/, this one was great. My partner enjoyed it a lot. I enjoyed it but I probably won't order it again.

I would definitely recommend the beef tartare on the regular menu - the seasoning was perfect and the hot mustard went so well with it. We got the appy size but next time I will be getting the full sized version! Out of the daily specials, the Iberico pork chops were amazing. The meat was succulent and melted in your mouth. The escargots were in some kind of Thai sauce which wasn't my favourite flavour profile but grew on me, and the duck pate was delish. There's a good wine selection and the option of getting a 1\/.

Their bowls of steaming, flavourful soups and chewy, perfectly cooked noodles are as huge and delicious as I remembered. Another pleasant surprise was that the service has not backslid at all either.

This fit the bill and was yummy. *Mung Bean Noodles - the mung bean noodles were thinner than I'm used to but still very tasty. The marinade was lovely and garlicky! I appreciate how they packaged it so that the sauce didn't spill everywhere *Marinated Egg - perfectly hardboiled and seasoned! All in all everything was quite good! Next time I'm in town, I'll definitely stop into the store to try more!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I came here for dinner yesterday evening.   We got seated in a booth right away.   I liked the ambiance of the place.  It was very contemporary and relaxed.   Service was efficient.   We were attended to and received water refills in a timely manner. I ordered the large classic beef noodles to share with my daughter.  This size is definitely large enough so that two people could share it comfortably. You also won't feel too full after. There was a decent amount of beef as well.  So how was it?  Very flavourful. I also ordered the lamb skewers. The lamb skewers were delicious. We really liked them.  But I thought they were a bit steep at almost $. Overall, this was an enjoyable dining experience. Good atmosphere, service, and nice food.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"3.8\/. Unfortunately menu rarely ever get updated but I guess your favorite dish will be there all the time.  Here are my personal go to dishes: beef tartare, duck liver parfait, escargot, beef bourguignon, tomate farcie and steak frites. Service here can get great to ok ish but never terrible. However, it can get pretty slow depending on days. Maison Selby's lovely ambiance alone made me revisit this place multiple times.  However, their EXTREMELY small tables that can barely fit dishes loses few points for me. Also, due to history of this place, this place is not wheelchair accessible and washroom is two floors below the main floor. They host numbers of events throughout yr like drag brunch or Halloween parties so keep your eyes out for events on their social media pages. Overall, this is a nice staple in this neighborhood. I hope they will continue staying with us by not afraid of continue improving.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Anticipating a taste of their truffle pasta during Summerlicious, I was disappointed to learn that it was missing from the menu, despite being on their website's a la carte selection for the season. Determined to indulge, I made a return visit to finally experience it. The $34., but the experience didn't quite justify the price tag. While the absence of chili flakes was a letdown, the unconventional hot sauce they offered took me by surprise with its spicy kick that I couldn't resist loving. Dining on the patio was lovely, except for an uninvited bee buzzing around.","Sentiment":"negative"}

{"Review Text":"I've been waiting to try this place for a while and finally had the chance! First off, this is located in a old, but charming mansion\/house that once was used as an all girls school (fun history fact! Hence the name Maison). I loved the charming place and it wasn't too busy on a weekday night. I ordered a couple of apps - the beef tartare and the escargot. The waiter also persuaded us to get the bread to dip the juices off the escargot, and I was sold. I loved all the dishes and can say that I was getting full just with the apps alone (thanks to the fluffy bread). For mains, we ordered the beef bourguignon and the truffle pasta. The beef was soo tender and the pasta came with visible shavings of truffle. The waiter was so friendly and funny, and really topped off the experience. All I can say is it's a lovely place to have an incredible evening and enjoy good food.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I think this is an easy for 4\/. I think the places that this restaurant excels in is in terms of its ambience. It has a really interesting interior that is cosy and get soft, relaxing Parisian vibe. You are definitely paying for a luxurious dining experience in terms of service and the restaurant interior. They have a lash seating and high quality glassware, and the dining experience makes it feel like a special occasion. The food is actually excellent, some dishes are better than others. In general, I think the downfall of this restaurant is that the price tag as a little bit too hard to justify the quality of the food and the drinks. I think the food quality is a little bit lower than expected for money, and for the ratings I found online. DISHES TO AVOID I had the French onion soup, which was very mediocre , the only thing that made it more flavourful was generous amount of cheese on top. We also had the oysters, which, of course I think they're better quality oysters on the seafood restaurant. I found the pineapple pur\u00e9e to be overpowering in the pickled flavour and you couldn't really taste the oyster quality. If you use the sauce, he wants a pair it with. I think the cocktails were very mediocre as well, there is a large selection if you're interested, but I find that the drinks for a little bit uninteresting. DISHES TO TRY We had to take a tagitallie with black truffle, which was exceptional, had a great amount of weight, and was generous with the amount of truffle in flavour that was on top. Could've been improved by offering fresh ground pepper, or Parmesan for the top. Beef tartare was excellent, and had a high-quality ingredients as a impactful flavour profile while keeping it simple. If you make the appetizer as a main dish and hot fries, the fries have an interesting flavor and are well spiced. Escargot was true to the french cuisine, and had a nice amount of sauce. They were large in size and not overcooked and were tender. They were served with delicious and well portioned baguette pieces that were well buttered and had a subtle flavor of garlic","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Well, if you are vegan this place isn't for you. But if you love cocktails and up for unique cocktails for brunch , you would love it. I had the best ever Gin based cocktail \"Bon Voyage \" for a Sunday brunch. The gin is custom made by Dillon's for Maison Selby. And it was one of the reason I wanted to try the place. I had peach waffle, it was exceptionally good but went easy on toppings, it felt a little dry or plain towards the end as the toppings weren't enough. Fries were amazing too. Salmon Benedict was okay but the quantity in general for the food was quite less. I mean if you are paying  ( tip excluded) for  , it should fill you up. Service was fine but the drink was the USP of the visit.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Summerlicious lunch review. Maison Selby might be my top pick out of the restaurants I've tried lately, all , had beautiful plating and interior, also good service. It was all good, so I'll hit the highlights - Appetizers were really nice, the berry dressing in the salad was really refreshing. My favourite of the mains was the Cornish hen, that was cooked just right and with a pretty interesting caramelized honey and spiced yogurt sauce. The desserts weren't lacking either, the crispy phyllo wrapped Camembert cheese was a perfect mix of sweet and salty, and with some roasted peach slices... I'm definitely going back here next time!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Gyubee is a fun place to go with a group and cook together. They have non-meat options such as salmon, clams, other seafood, and vegetables. The concept is All You Can Eat (AYCE). Unlike Korean BBQ which focuses on soaking and marinating the ingredients, Japanese BBQ uses more of a 'dipping' technique. The dipping sauces incorporate soy sauce, mirin (a type of red wine for cooking), and garlic.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"First time trying Gyubee and also the first time I had AYCE BBQ in years! Lunch was $26. $28.. My friend and I came here . Minus the occasional fire alarms that would go off, the ambience was good. We got both cuts of the beef (the sweet soy marinated short rib and sweet soy beef brisket) and I got the shrimp. I like how they marinate the meat as it added more flavour. I got to try the bibimbap which was good but next time I will pass on it to enjoy more of the other food. We shared the side orders and my favourites were the kimchi, lettuce, bean sprout, and ssamjang. We also shared two butter corns which were good. Looking back, I forgot to get mushrooms and the seaweed salad so that's on the list for next time. We shared a pitcher of peach mojito and it was refreshing. Didn't really taste the alcohol in it though. I was definitely very full after the meal and to top it off we got melona (1\/person). That day, they had either strawberry and coconut. I got the coconut and it was good! Service was straightforward and quick. I like how the servers don't gatekeep portions compared to other BBQ places I've been to. TLDR: I understand the hype. Solid Japanese AYCE BBQ restaurant with good service.","Sentiment":"positive"}

We came early evening Tuesday night and the place only had a few people there however service was friendly and quick. I tried the game-sausage sampler, and had the Kaas (pork sausage with cheese) currywurst style. Tip! Get it this way if you are cutting back on carbs. KAAS Sausage was so juicy with the right mix of fattiness and melty cheese. The game sausages were on the leaner side but didn't taste too different to me.

The service was extraordinary and the food was divine. The place was full with lots of groups but my wife and I were attended to just as well as the larger tables. The drinks were excellent as well. Our table was at the front of the restaurant which gave us a front and center view of all the action. Everything was clean and orderly and not loud at all even with a full restaurant. In the midst of eating though I watched the staff which is just something I do sometimes in restaurants. These folks run like a well oiled machine. Everyone watches over the diners and while you are never hounded with \"is everything okay?\" You will feel that folks are watching over you and if you need anything you are just a glance or raised hand away from anything you want.

There is a sort of traditional Italian vibe present, from the elegant ambience to the courtesy of the staff and certainly to the heavenly food. We were here for a business lunch, and almost everyone (wisely) decided on one of their pasta dishes. Rave reviews all around the table! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauces all bursting with flavours. My calamarata also came with a variety of seafood - the shrimp was particularly scrumptious. Just one of their appetizers fell flat - the burrata was rather bland. On the other hand, the complimentary bread was unequivocally among the finest I've had, crisp on the outside while soft on the inside, drenched in olive oil with a sprinkle of rosemary...I couldn't stop myself from gorging on half a plate. There is sufficient space between the seats, and it never got very loud even during the lunch rush. Service was exemplary, our waiter never missed a beat when it came to taking our orders, refilling our glasses, or getting the bill - he just somehow magically appeared at exactly the right time. This place is easily one of the most authentic Italian restaurants around the downtown core - would definitely recommend, if your wallet can handle it!","Sentiment":"positive"}

And they spoke Italian and I knew immediately we would have a wonderful dinner. Please - order the bread. It's served hot on olive oil (but not too much) - it's got a nice crisp crunch & is topped with some rosemary. I looked away & my co-workers ate it all so we ordered more. We decided to split a Tuna Tartare. It's delicious but please note - it's served with avocado (I'm sure you can request it without) and Taro Chips (however- save some bread because yum) I could not decide between the pappardelle with wild boar ragu & the Vitello Limone - so they said how about a taster of the pasta with the veal!  I highly recommend this - or split some pastas. -workers split the lasagna & penne pastas And my other co-worker ordered the spaghettini with black tiger shrimp. He loved it. Desserts (all homemade including the gelato & sherbets) We split the pear & apple strudel & I tried the strawberry sherbet. I asked the guys to rate our experience and the consensus 4.5\/.

I did enjoy the beef carpaccio. It was fresh & flavourable and the olive oil was good. Also, the bread is as delicious as I remember. However, I must say that the ravioli was bland and more than al dente. The tomatoes were mostly just skin which made for an unpleasant bite.

{"Review Text":"I embarked on a delightful culinary adventure one fine Tuesday evening, lured by the promise of a tantalizing half-price steak platter, a sizzling symphony of flavors that came accompanied by a generous serving of golden fries and a crisp, refreshing salad. As I took my seat, the anticipation of what was to come danced in my mind, and I couldn't help but wonder if this feast would live up to its reputation. The moment of truth arrived, and let me tell you, dear readers, that steak was an absolute revelation. It was a juicy masterpiece, so succulent that it seemed to beckon for a partner to share in its glory. And indeed, the portion was generous enough to satisfy the hunger of two eager diners. As I sipped on my drink (La Madinia), for $16.'t help but take in the ambiance of the restaurant. It was a haven of cleanliness and warmth, beckoning patrons to indulge in culinary delights. However, a shadow was cast over this otherwise idyllic evening by the slow service. My inquiries were met with an unusual silence from the bustling waitstaff. They appeared to be caught in the whirlwind of their tasks, leaving me to ponder whether I was invisible or simply overlooked. Despite the bustling crowd, my presence went unnoticed more than once, and I found myself questioning if I had somehow offended the very fabric of time and space. Yet, all was not lost. The kitchen, a realm of culinary wizardry, was a stark contrast to my service ordeal. The chefs toiled with a passion that was evident in every dish that emerged from their domain. They radiated friendliness and a genuine desire to craft the perfect meal. And then, a glimmer of redemption came in the form of a free dessert, an unspoken apology for the earlier lapses in service. It was a sweet gesture that, while appreciated, could not entirely mend the cracks in the evening's experience. In sum, dear readers, this restaurant is a tale of two worlds. The food, especially the heavenly steak platter, is a culinary triumph that beckons food lovers near and far. The chefs in their open kitchen are culinary maestros who take pride in their craft. However, the service, marred by a lack of attention and communication, leaves something to be desired. Yet, in their quest for redemption, a free dessert emerged as a silver lining. So, should you venture into this establishment? If your heart craves exquisite steak and an unforgettable gastronomic journey, the answer is a resounding yes. Just be prepared to exercise patience and perhaps, like me, you'll leave with a sweet gesture to sweeten the memory of your visit.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Came here with a couple friends to try out the Tuesday deal of half price cote do boeuf and it was absolutely worth it. Upon walking into the restaurant you notice that it's very lively and everyone's having a good time. It's nicely lit, and there's a lot of seating inside, but there's also some patio seating as well for people that are looking to sit outside. We got a couple appetizers; octopus and mussels, and then the cote du boeuf as our main. The appetizers were pretty good, but the main focus of the meal was definitely the steak. It was cooked perfectly and seasoned very nicely. Overall everything tasted really delicious and I highly recommend checking out the Tuesday deal.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Finally got to come here again after two years. My partner and I really enjoyed the food the first time we went so we've been wanting to go. We went to a different location before and this one had a cute French bistro feeling to it. It wasn't too busy on a Monday night and there were only a few tables (I believe they also have a back patio). We grabbed the cote de beouf and some drinks as well. The steak came with salad and fries. It was cooked perfectly and seasoned well (although I did find some parts to be slightly salty). Was surprised how the fries stayed crispy despite being under the steak. They gave us such a huge piece that we didn't have room for dessert. Would definitely come back here again.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Issa vibe, is what the kids say. The ambiance at this place is perfect. Cozy. Cosmopolitan. Alive. Sexy. I don't know if it was the nostalgia of being on Queen West after so long or the perfect lighting, or the sophisticated cacophony, or the in-crowd vibe, but Jules Bistro was a hive of coolness tonight.  It wasn't even because I was there...that usually deducts points on the cool scale, it was just the moment, intersected with a well appointed space and human energy. And the food, pray tell? Scallop appetizer: Beautiful. Steak frites: The frites were next level. Think McDonald's but if it didn't make you regret it after ten minutes. Maybe they do them in duck fat or something but they were crisp without being greasy,  savoury without being too salty, and addictive without being obscene. The 6oz sirloin was cooked nicely but had gristle that was too hard to handle. Maybe not rendered fully or something...it detracted from what was an otherwise decent steak. At $30, it was priced fairly...any more and I would have been annoyed with the proportion that was inedible because of the gristle. My dining companions had the pickerel special, which they enjoyed and looked delicious. It was pricey at $'t complain. Overall, the food and the service were good but took a back seat to the ambiance. I'll be back to soak it all in. A la prochaine, cher Jules","Sentiment":"positive"}

Lots of great brews on tap including Belgium Delirium. If you're a beer lover, it's a keeper.  Wonderful flavor. But watch out - those DTs are high alcohol content. They are refreshing so easy drinking but may have a \"buzz\" effect. Good news though - natural ingredients so you won't feel too bad the next day.  Lol On busy days, service may be a tad slow, but a nice place to go where you don't have to feel rushed! My friend had the Beef Tenderloin Tacos which he said was very good. I had a daily special which was Chicken with a Mole sauce, rice and fresh veg. The mole sauce was so so but the meal overall was fine. Will definitely go back and try another menu option but will stick with that Delirium Beer!","Sentiment":"positive"}

The food was decent but nothing to write home about. My burger was a tad dry, but the poutine and grilled cheese were pretty good!

{"Review Text":"I have passed by so many times and a rainy day like today was the ideal opportunity to try it for the first time. I got the shoyu ramen and it was fantastic. The true standout is the broth, which is rich with flavour that is umami and salty, but not overly salty. It tastes incredibly balanced and clean. I initially thought the regular bowl was quite small, but in the end was very satisfied. The actual noodles are on the chewier side. You also get cha shiu, nothing special but delicious. I added the marinated egg which was cooked perfectly and a perfect addition. We also got pork gyoza which were juicy and crispy. Overall, exceeded my expectations!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Broth: 2.5\/: 4\/: 2\/: 3\/, but it needs to up its game a little nowadays. The spicy miso broth was pretty good, though the noodles served could have been a bit thicker to complement the heavy broth. The meat served was a slow cooked thick cut fatty pork. My opinion though is that the pork should have been served sliced thinly instead because of the significant level of fat, or pick a different meatier cut instead. The fatty pork also did not hold a lot of its own flavour. The tsukemen had great noodles with good bite, perfect for dipping in an intensely flavourful broth. However, the broth was definitely cut down with a lighter broth or water, leading to a watery soup that is not easily caught by the noodles. Also, the meat served was lackluster, consisting of only little bits of meat within the soup. The service was quick and the restaurant is larger than the usual downtown ramen fare, but the rating places more emphasis on the food in the pictures.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The pork bowl was just salty in general. i've only tried the spicy ramen and it did not meet my expectation. broth was salty, very few toppings, and the noodles tasted processed. i'm surprised that this place is usually crowded...there are better ramen spots like ramen isshin (college and bathurst) or kyouka ramen (queen e)","Sentiment":"positive"}

The steak was very tender, and was cooked perfectly. My partner's dish was all over the place. Although the sides were okay, some cuts of the steak were well done and others were blue rare. The other guests in our party ordered the same dish and didn't have this issue. When we brought this to the attention of the staff, they brought us a hot plate to cook our own meat. Service: We were seated quite quickly with a reservation, but they didn't address our issue appropriately and they were not very flexible in terms of splitting bills. They tack on a service fee for groups, and we were only allowed one bill. They did not deal with our steak (some rare, some overcooked) by replacing it, and it was actually quite insulting asking it to cook it ourselves. Unless this issue is addressed, I will not be revisiting.

And the sisig, which is typically made with less common animal parts was anything but. Overall, the food was bland and boring, and the restaurant is understaffed for its size.","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"We did a food hopping experience in queen west and stumbled across this place accidentally. We saw that they're reviewed very well. So wanted to give it a try. We had their peanut slaw which was a very generous portion and it tasted great too. Lacked seasoning but once we added salt, it turned out really delicious. The ambiance is very cosy. I really wanted to try red horse beer which is very popular in Philippines but they were out. I can't wait to come back and try other items. For those who eat meat, looks like the meat platter is a good option. Lots of people were ordering that..","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Ukoy salad was tasty and snappy, especially with the fried sweet potato and onion adding great texture to the leafy greens. Sesig was steaming hot and a must pick. Service was a bit lacking, and interior was super dark but hip. Music selection was a bit all over the place. Would come back again.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The food came out longer than expected but understandable since we ordered . I like how the feast also comes with desserts! They were very accommodating, we were a large crowd and they even let us bring a cake. The restaurant is smaller than expected, I would recommend reserving.

Although I wasn't able to snap a photo this time, the Boodle Fight option (massive feast served on banana leaves) is a great option, but the meat skewers (chicken and pork for us) were ridiculously amazing. The staff continue to be attentive despite being consistently busy and packed. The drink specials are also a great option if you haven't quite decided on what to try but you're in the mood for cocktails. All-in-all, I am happy to keep recommending this place as it hasn't disappointed yet.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"A Korean, Japanese, and a Chinese guy walks into a Filipino Restaurant... and... that's all I got!  AND I'm being serious! An All Asian night - it's like a production of Crazy Rich Asian - LOL! Before heading to the Snow Magic YEE (that's on another review - brace yourself Winter is Coming ..LOL), we needed some eats. When you have a Foodie Influencer, Media Influencer, and a Chef, trying to figure out where to go, it's gonna be difficult to find a place.  The food needs to be excellent, the place needs to be trendy, and must be Chef approved. Well, Islas it is... I haven't been to a great Filipino place as there are just a handful of them downtown.  This was recommended by our Chef dude, so food must be great.  I wonder if it will be a hole in the wall, especially where it is located - media guy might have an issue.  ;P OK... I'm gonna say, this place ticks all the boxes.  It's a beautifully decorated, the food is deliciously plated, and Chef Marc Bonaventura knows how to cook. We had the Lechon Wings to start, some brews, and the Chef Tasting Menu. The tasting menu was the BOODELI 'TWO' !!!! :D Whole fish snapper, chicken bbq, bagnet crispy pork belly, short ribs, baked empanada, lumpia crispy spring rolls, peanut slaw salad, fruits, garlic fried rice and dessert served on banana leaves. We are going Kamayan!!!  For those who do not know, don't look it up!  Go and get some.  If you go Kamayan, you never come back to utensils - LOL! A great night of food and friends! CHEERS!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Came here with friends for some afternoon snacks, not really to drink, and the server seemed a bit annoyed by that. The food was hit or miss, and very tiny portions for a high price. The Reuben sandwich was probably the best tasting thing I had. The Korean fried chicken and general TSO-fu was ok. The Bao and eggplant sandwich were ok too according to my friends. There wasn't really anything to justify the price... The kitchen was not connected to the dining\/bar area so the server had to carry them from outside which was a bit strange to me. Note that this is a small bar and is best to only go with a smaller group, and if you plan to drink AND if you've eaten already or plan to eat a meal elsewhere","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Food was 10\/. Their drinks menu was limited aka classic drinks only, with a limited menu you should make sure every drink is a hit. For context, a Paloma and a \"spicy\" (use the term lightly) margarita tasted exactly the same. But don't bother asking any clarifying questions, the place has  \"been open , and this is how it's always been done\" so it must be right","Sentiment":"negative"}

{"Review Text":"A special nondescript spot with great small bites and a wide selection of drinks. As the name implies there's only small plates here but they are very reasonably priced ($5-$8), and if you combine several of them you'll end up with a pretty filling meal. There's no utensils so be warned that certain dishes can get a bit messy. The food is fun because it spans many different cuisines - i had general tso tofu, eggplant parmesan sandwich, trinidadian doubles and an indian style aloo (potato) chaat. Excellent vegetarian selections. There's one dessert item currently and that's a custom chocolate bar they make called the snackers. There's tons of drink options - I stuck to the cocktails, for which they have no menu. Instead you can ask the staff for what type of drink you're craving and they'll make something that matches your description. The manager gave us a couple of great drinks - a jungle bird and a modified daiquiri - both were delicious! A big part that added to the experience was how friendly the staff, especially the manager (who is waiting tables and taking orders too) is. His drink recommendations were great and he took time to explain all ingredients in the cocktails and even the proportions. A final note on how great the vibe and ambiance is. It's a great date spot with dim lighting, and a candle on each table. The music fit perfectly (anderson paak mostly, some kendrick) with the overall vibe of the place. Note that the place is pretty small and most tables are for 2.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Servers were kind and friendly. The atmosphere was rustic and unique. I would not order any food here, the Korean Fried Chicken was using a Chinese flavoured sauce, and it was ground or minced chicken than breast or thigh. Texture was off and taste was the wrong region completely. The beef tartare was overpriced, instead of having the tartare on the side with bread, they just smear it on the bread itself. Very little beef, and the flavour was not there. Much better tartare elsewhere. Finished off with the ube crinkle creme brulee cake, awful. Dry, spongey, no ube flavour. Did not have any drinks, but they looked good. Just don't get the food.","Sentiment":"negative"}

{"Review Text":"Food: The food was good, and came quicker than I expected. For the appetizer hubby and I shared the local fried chicken with a Dragon glaze. The dragon glaze was a little bit spicy for me but fine for hubby. For the main entr\u00e9e, I had the steak and fries. It was done as per my request of medium well done. It was good but it didn't blow my mind. Just decent pub style food. Hubby had the burger and fries. He said that the quality of the burger was good as well. For dessert we have the peanut butter and chocolate cup without ice cream. That was rich and creamy and decadent. It wasn't too sweet, which was nice. Service: We had a nice lady as our waitress. She had ginger hair, so hubby was making ginger jokes with her because he's a ginger too. She was friendly, and also efficient. Ambience:  One thing I didn't like about this place was how loud the music was. I almost felt like I was at a concert. I had to  yell to talk to hubby, and he was right beside me. Also, they have a lot of the barstool type seating with tables. For short people like me and hubby it's not so easy to get into those tall stools. But other than  than that the decor is pretty typical of pubs. Leather back seats, wooden tables and barstools. The washrooms are all individual washrooms and there are plenty of them. I think there were at least six of them. Always good to have more washrooms I think. I will say that it was nice that they have a lift for those with baby strollers or wheelchairs to get them to the main floor. But it took them some time to find someone amongst the staff who knew how to operate it. They also have an outdoor patio with the corn hole game. The patio is partially covered so you could sit out there even if it's raining. If they would turn the volume down I would consider coming here again. The music was actually giving me a headache.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The app took -out orders, and the server gave us fries to compensate. The Rockefeller oysters have caramelized fennel, wilted spinach, mornay sauce, parm, and cajun gremolata. It was on the saltier side and extra buttery. My preference is to get fresh oysters. The lobster bisque had good flavour and some lobster pieces, but it needed to be creamier. The lobster mac and cheese was the star of our meal. So cheesy, with enough lobster pieces, and the pasta was perfectly cooked. The fries were crispy and on the meatier side. Overall, service was 5\/5 - we appreciate the free fries gesture for the delayed service. There was a non-alcoholic mojito for those doing Dry January or want a non-alcoholic option.

With kitschy marine decor that says more \"fish and chips\" than oysters, it's not too fancy, but that's part of the charm. Always book this in advance if you can; it's often busy. We sat at the bar; it was a bit crowded, but fun to watch all of the activity going on. Also, who knew that people were getting oysters for take-out? They load up take-out containers with ice and set the shucked oysters on them-- how about that? We tried the poutine and the soup, but obviously, the highlight of the meal were the oysters. As it should be!","Sentiment":"positive"}

Better than la vecchia. Stock. Pizza Neopolitan style - leoparding on the bottom. Could've chatted a bit more on the crust. Delicious dough, thin and crispy. The cheese and sauce was lacking in flavour. Store bought buffalo mozz has a higher milk flavor than these guys and the sauce was just kinda basic. The roasted garlic saves it. Cacio e pepe Delicious sauce base with plenty Romano pecorino (forget what it is) and pepper. Slightly a bit too el dente for me though. Octopus Beautifully done. Squash My favourite.

{"Review Text":"I'm not one to rate establishments . Giulietta is IMO by far the best Italian in the city I've come across. I hear they have a sister location that is more upscale and will surely try. But to stick to this one - the food, the service, the execution, the overall vibe is all a level up. In a city filled with many Italian restaurants and establishments, many good, many questionable and some just flat out pretentious and unapproachable -- Giulietta is top notch. The seating from main floor to the bar to the chefs table is all inviting. The menu is legit chalk full with some Italian staples that look and sound easy going but to execute are hard and if done wrong can ruin dinners, they do it all right. We sat at the chefs table. The staff all around there are awesome. I think every plate coming out behind the chefs table was executed to perfection, meticulously hard crafted with details to everything and looked delicious. The kind of place you would want to try anything in the menu and be a regular of. My try's:","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Had such a great experience at Giulietta last night for a little pre-valentines date night. We enjoyed everything from the food, to the service to the ambience! To start we ordered the Polpo e Fagioli (grilled octopus) as this was highly recommended by everyone. I am not usually the biggest fan of octopus, but this was one was so well done! It was cooked perfectly; so tender and with a delicious charred flavour. It was also topped with a yummy salsa verde which really elevated the dish. For mains, we ordered the Ravioli Al Tartufo and L'amentea pizza. The ravioli was super rich and cheesy, and you could really taste the truffle in the dish. It was quite heavy and left me very full. My favourite dish of the night however, ended up being the L'amentea pizza! It tasted so fresh, the crust was perfectly thin and crispy and was topped with a spicy sopressata. I was quite impressed with the spice level! I also recommended ordering honey to put on top, it balanced out the spice perfectly. We were too full for dessert, and initially said no and got our checks. However I saw the couple next to us order the house made gelato which looked incredible! Our server heard us debating on getting the gelato and she was kind enough to bring us a small gelato portion on the house! It was rich and chocolatey and wonderful. We really had the perfect date night here!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Been wanting to try Giulietta forever and finally for a reso for the birthday weekend! Tartare Di Manzo Belgioiso Burrata Risotto Di Aragosta Brodetto Di Pesce Torta Della Nonna This was hands down one of my all time fav beef tartare and burrata  all of the seafood components in the pesce were cooked perfectly! The Risotto had so many diced pieces of Lobster in it, very flavourful and meaty but the Risotto was al dente and I personally prefer when it's softer and more goey tasting but it was still delicious. Can't wait to come back to try more dishes!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Went here for my birthday celebration this year after hearing nothing but good things about it. Ordered and shared: beligioiso burrata, cacio e pepe, risotto aragosta, la Valentina pizza, and la campagnola pizza. The risotto was the best risotto I've had from a restaurant ever and the shrimp was perfection. The pizza was great as was the burrata! The major disappointment was the cacio e pepe. I love a good al dente pasta but this was just undercooked and the coating lacked flavour and was very thin. The atmosphere was chic and the open kitchen made the whole time an experience. Huge shout out to the waiting staff! I could go on and write a whole review on just them and it would be just as long as this, absolutely fabulous service. Overall it was an amazing experience and will definitely be back to give the cacio e pepe a second try as even our favourite places can have off nights.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Insanely good calamari, & the brodett\u00f2 di pesce was out of this world. Definitely comparable to some of the seafood stews I've had while travelling in Europe. It comes with two nice big hunks of crispy toasted bread for soaking up every last bit of the delicious sauce. The service was fantastic - very kind, outgoing & friendly, which created a fun lovely environment to be in. They also gave three glasses of champagne on the house since we were celebrating a birthday, which was a lovely, much appreciated touch. The restaurant itself is also gorgeous - very modern & intimate. I'll be sure to return.","Sentiment":"positive"}

From the fact that the sign is slightly hidden from a far, to the rich, bold and tasty flavours from all the dishes I've had, they were worth coming here for. They are open for brunch and dinner but I suggest you come here for dinner (although I never came here for brunch). The late night vibe is really relaxing to experience alongside the amazing food. They close at 10pm. As far as ordering from their menu, think of this place as a course menu type of bistro. (Appetiser, Entree (and Dessert if your tummy desires lol)) The servers always checked on us and were very friendly. Worth tipping a lot. Also, p.s. the 's a lot but if you feel hungry right before going there, . But if not, might be better to stick with the  (only Appetiser and Entree).","Sentiment":"positive"}

Our desserts were fantastic. Our server was very kind and cordial. The food and service were excellent but for one issue. We booked our reservation three weeks in advance yet we were sat at the weird table beside the entrance of the kitchen. It has smaller chairs and a narrow bench. I noticed couples seated at tables for four and I just thought it could have been more thoughtfully arranged. Fortunately we were able to be moved however we would have to leave on a tight timeline. It all worked out in the end.  And our server made everything very pleasant.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Great spot in Parkdale serving French course menu fare. Generous portions, fair bit of seasonal ingredients, and excellent service during our first experience here. Started with steamed mussels and calamari with some sourdough. Calamari was a touch overdone. Mussels were great and plentiful. Mains were very filling and delicious! We had the duck and seasonal rabbit. The proteins were cooked perfectly - very tender. Dessert was just ok. The small and intimate restaurant feels warm and welcoming and our server was very attentive. Definitely worth a try!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Had a really great meal here recently - first of all, the restaurant is really cozy and a great option for dates and small groups of friends. The decor and ambiance is relaxed and very warm. Our server was quite helpful and recommended their daily specials to us. We ended up getting a 3-course set ($58) and a 2-course set ($48) with the only difference being dessert. The appetizers were pretty good but nothing outstanding - the calamari was especially underwhelming and portion was a little small. The escargot was quite yummy with a creamy mushroom sauce. The entrees were both very nice portions and delicious! I highly recommend the duck breast and it was probably my favorite dish of the night. Last but definitely not least, the berry dessert was a great way to finish off the meal. I definitely recommend this place for a cute date night or fun meal with friends :)","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We came here to celebrate a special event. The restaurant was small and packed with people for dinner. We chose the 2-course menu per person, and decided to eat the cake we brought instead of ordering dessert here (cake open fee was $25). The food was mediocre here, with portion on the smaller side for appetizers, and missing some cooking fundamentals for the mains. Most of the appetizers were not bad. The tuna salad was refreshing. Smoked fish and platter with pate both tasted good, but portion was tiny. The squid tasted really plain though. When it comes to the main course, there are misses everywhere. The lamb was relatively the best among all, but was served with really small portion and majority of the meat was fats. Duck   was undercooked, meat quality was not good. It was very hard to chew. Fish was okay but not wowing. The worst was the pork. The cooking fundamentals is to have chicken or pork well done to avoid any food poisoning. However, the middle of the pork meat was still quite red!!! This is not okay cooking. Overall, the service and food quality was mediocre. I wouldn't consider revisiting.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Took my boyfriend here for a birthday dinner and wow, I'm really glad I found this spot. Thank you to my fellow Yelpers! & Thanks to Ryan and the lovely lady who served the entire front of house. So efficient and wonderful! More on this later!! Lovely French cuisine here. Simple and delicious! It's prefix menu style which I actually quite like. It seems the menu has changed and they have different specials, so it keeps things interesting! Definitely was a fantastic value. We decided to go for the full . I got the gravlax which is their homemade smoked salmon with a salad, bread and dollop of bourgin. Delicious!! Really beautiful flavor without being overly salty. We also ordered the special to share which was pate en croute I believe. It was also delicious, serviced with grainy mustard, gerkins and salad. For mains I got the duck and my boyfriend got the lamb. I enjoyed my lamb but I did find the sauce on both a tad salty. I loved the roasted veggies and omg they made the layered potatoes. My favorite!!! For dessert, I got the mille feuilles aux framboise. It was absolutely heavenly and I wish it would stay in the menu forever!!! We also ordered the chocolate mousse with amaretto. So rich and not overly sweet. I almost never like desserts and this was two for two win!! What a fantastic way to finish the meal. Ryan and the really wonderful lady server whose name I didn't catch (sorry!!) We're fantastic. We had one hiccup which was unfortunately lipstick on my glass from the last patron. A huge no no for me once I see this but they were quick to apologize and address it. And they were fantastic the rest of the night. Checked in just enough, and I think what I loved most is that they looked like they were having fun. They were enjoying their night and joking with the patrons, being so welcoming. I can't remember the last time I saw a server that wasn't completely stressed or rushed. This made the meal so much more enjoyable. A laugh here, fantastic bite of food there. 100% would recommend!!!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"If I had to describe this restaurant in one word, it would be - mediocre. We went for dinner a couple of weeks back. The hostess was very pleasant and had us seated. Good start. Now for the not so good Volos is priced as a higher end restaurant. The first impression one gets is the decor. We were seated near the kitchen. Where it was quite ordinary. The ceiling was open and you could see the vents and wiring. Average looking chairs. With the prices Volos charges, decor should be a factor. The biggest disappointment was our server. We planned to share several appetizers rather than ordering mains. Her face visibly fell when she heard that. We ended up ordering over , so it wasn't a cheap evening. Plus dessert. However, our server never stopped by after taking our initial drink and dinner order. So much so that we had to ask another server to get us more drinks. At which she magically reappeared at our table with the drinks. The food itself was also mediocre. Compare it one of the older and better known restaurants in the Danforth. For the prices they charge, you are much better off going to other $$$ restaurants in the downtown area.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Went for our Team lunch (party of 9) and everyone had a great time as both food and service were exemplary. Started off with the Saganaki and Grilled Calamari for appetizers. We really liked the Saganaki as it's not overly salty considering they used kefalotyri cheese. The grilled calamari consists of mix greens,is lightly charred and goes well with the bell peppers, onions, olives and vinaigrette. For our mains, the dishes ranges from seafood where someone ordered the Grilled Whole Sea Bass & Fisherman's Stew, pasta (Orecchiette Pasta) and meats - Braised Lamb Shank & Grilled Organic Chicken Breast. The star of the show imo is the Braised Lamb Shank.  Not really a fan of lamb due to their grassy\/gamey taste but nowhere will you get this taste from Volos' lamb shank.  Rich, juicy and flavourful, the fall-of-the-bone lamb shank is so succulent. Every bite sets off a happy fireworks on your tongue that you can't get enough of it! Another stellar dish is their Saffron Pistachio Ice Cream.  Incredibly creamy and with the predominant taste and smell of the saffron, I really love this dessert. This dessert is swoon worthy and not to be missed here. Yes Volos is on the pricey side but the experience and quality of food alone are worth both the price. Also one of the few restaurants who doesn't add automatic gratuity for large parties which is surprising since almost all the restaurants we've been to are doing this. This practice alone will entice us into coming back to Volos.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We really enjoyed our meal here.  Great ambience and service.   We enjoyed the Orecchiette pasta with Shrimp which was delicious.

Octopus : As a person who has never liked Octopus, I gotta say I was right because none of them were as good as this one! 3. Lamb Shank: The look is enough. I can't say more. THE BEST. TENDER AND GREAT! 4. Baklava: Was good, nothing bad about it. All in all, I definitely suggest here!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Oh my goodness! This restaurant is amazing! I was so impressed overall, by the ambience, the service and the food! I dined here as a part of a large group dinner in the private room. I was greeted by a very pleasant hostess in the midst of a busy evening in the restaurant, and I appreciated her attention to each arriving customer. Our group dinner was held in the private room which does have doors which close to block out the rest of the restaurant, although you can still hear the noise. We were greeted with a selection of Septima wines, both white and red, which are amazing, with appetizers including sesame crusted feta, chicken skewers, and spanakopita. Everyone raved about the sesame crusted feta!! Our set dinner menu included shared appetizers of the horiatiki salad, the grilled octopus, and the saganaki, all of which were amazing!! My main dish was the lobster kritharoto, which I was so excited to try! I have to say though, that I let the restaurant know in advance that I would have to leave early, and unfortunately, the mains came out later than expected, so I really didn't have much time to try this much-anticipated dish. What I was able to try was great! I just wish that I could've finished it, and have experienced the ouzo chocolate mousse I had ordered, but again was not able to experience given the timing of the meal. Overall, I'm so impressed by this restaurant, and in particular,  the staff and the food. We had an excellent server, Moni, who was very attentive and provided great service!!

{"Review Text":"Went here with a craving for Italian, but was quite disappointed in what I got. The restaurant is large and has a very lively atmosphere. It seems very fitting for a family dinner and for children. They do have a large menu that covers everything from classic Italian antipasti and soups, to pizzas and pastas. After reading many positive reviews I went in pretty optimistic. There was two of us in my party and we ordered the Kale and Beet salad, mussels in tomato sauce and the Napoletana (linguine with shrimps and clams). Everything was very average and not very flavourful. The kale in salad was too tough and the dressing a bit too tangy for my liking; the mussels were a bit plain, kind of spicy but not very tomatoe-y; but the pasta was probably my favourite of the night. Nice amount of shrimps and clams, tossed nicely in the tomato sauce. Considering that many people do enjoy the food here, perhaps it just wasn't to my preference for Italian food! I did see many tables ordering pizza which we didn't opt to do...perhaps the pizzas are the star of the show. Not sure if I would come back here but I'd be willing to give it a second try.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Their menu is split into tomato sauce, cream sauce, garlic\/ virgin oil, and creamy tomato sauce, which I found super helpful in making my choice easier from their large menu. I got their Milano pasta which is a linguine with grilled chicken, sundried tomatoes and snow peas. Their portions were all really big and the pasta was cooked al dente. I really enjoyed roasted tomatoes in my pasta too! All my friends also really liked their pasta as well and they all got different ones from cream to tomato to pesto pasta!

No fancy stuff--just a hearty, creamy tomato sauce with a spicy kick from the pancetta. The rigatoni was perfectly al dente, making the whole experience luscious. We also ordered the Nato pizza, which was good and had a crispy bottom, but let's be honest, it was overshadowed by the Penza. Next time, I'll definitely save my appetite for their pasta.

I didn't even have to ask for tabasco as the waiter asked me for it first Seared foie gras and maple apples with current puree: This was divine! The seared part had a slight crunch but the inside was smooth, rich and buttery. The apple added sweetness and texture as well. Beef tartare with foie gras: This was the first time having tartare with foie gras pate and I wish it was done more. It adds an extra layer of richness that was a good complement Rack of lamb: The lamb was perfectly medium rare, and I loved the accompaniments. I always saw fiddleheads at the grocer but never was brave enough to make it. I love the crunch and texture and light flavor Iberico pork chop: This was pretty good, the pork was tender but I couldn't really taste the iberico in it (perhaps i'm used to the nutty taste), the creamed spinach accompaniment was pretty good too Nutella beignets with cinnamon ice cream: This was so good! The beignets were filled with nutella and the cinnamon ice cream was a great complement Honey creme brulee with lemon curd and cream cheese: This was like a big slice of creme brulee lol, much bigger portion than many I've had. I couldn't really taste the lemon though The wine list consisted of an entire textbook categorized by region. It was super in depth and the Chianti we got was delicious and reasonably priced. I can't say the same for some other vintages that I saw for like 60k though  definitely recommend for an intimate date night!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Long story short: Expensive but delicious food, tainted by a poor service experience. Long story long: I ordered the halibut, which was a decent portion, fresh, delicious and had nice presentation. The food was great and I had no issues with it. As you can tell, I'm not very excited about the food though, because the service was a bit pushy from some of the staff and tainted my whole experience of ever dining at Opus again. After giving my order from a shorter, large-party menu, the waiter remained, asking about my appetizer. I repeated that I wasn't interested, but was told \"everyone else has one.\" I thought, perhaps it was a prix fixe menu, as there were no prices on our menus, which can be standard for larger parties. When I clarified if this was a fixe menu and if I *had* to, I was told 'yes', when this wasn't actually the case. I felt quite pressured, tricked and uncomfortable. I addressed this a couple of minutes later (it was truly ), because I didn't want it. The waiter told me that he would have to check with the kitchen, since he had already submitted the order. A friend of mine at the table experienced the same thing, saying that they didn't initially want their appetizer either. My app order was cancelled. I understand trying to offer and getting an extra sale, but if only the waiter listened to my repeated \"no, thank yous\", this wouldn't have dragged on and I wouldn't have to leave a review like this. The other waiters were lovely, attentive and with great conversation, but unfortunately, this experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. Fine dining is not just about food, it's a whole experience, and you can find better elsewhere.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Our server was very pleasant, and definitely very knowledgable about the menu as he was explaining new special items they had and also on any food items we asked about. He made good recommendations as I was looking for a sweeter drink and he offered this martini that definitely hit the spot. We were still unsure of our order but he was okay with coming back every few minutes to ensure we were ready. Their dinner menu as a good selection of appetizers, and main courses that will even suit vegetarians. What they're also really known for is the selection of wine (it's a whole book)! For our appetizers, i really enjoyed the seared foie gras as it came in a sweet apple sauce that perfect blended together. I ordered one of the specials which was red deer meat (which was also my first time trying), and it was quite pleasant. Our server recommended it to be medium rare which I was sceptical at first since I usually order medium, but it turned out he was right! Personally, I thought the portions were just right where you would feel full but not stuffed, so I wouldn't have any complaints. We wanted photos taken and Tasha\/ another server helped us take the best photos possible which also made the experience and night even better. Thank you for a lovely night!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"This is my second time to dine in Opus, again excellent service and high quality of food and wine does not disappoint me!  The oyster from PEI are so fresh, way better than most oyster places, but it is on the more expensive side of the price.  The steak is well cooked at medium rare, and my blackened tuna is so amazing. We also had the snow crab meat with radish for app, the portion of snow crab meat is very good!  I will go again next time to try out their other entree","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Probably the most disappointing fine dining experience that I've had. The food is okay but lacks a \"wow\" factor. The plates all seem to have one consistency... Mushy. We were a party of , we ordered the parsnip puree, scallops, bison tenderloin, strip loin, sea buthorne mousse. We originally went for the sea bass but they were sold out. (note that there was also a special menu available for that evening and the sea bass is a regular item... Also note that the menu on the website was not the same as in restaurant). The parsnip puree had to be shaken out of the teapot for it to be served (odd) and was overly sweet for my palette. Not to mention the dirty plate it was served on that left brown marks on the white table cloth. The scallops were cooked very well and were probably my favorite thing of the evening. That being said the dish seemed a little one note... And why is everything on the plate white? The bison tenderloin was quite tasty but easy over powered by the amount of salt and butter in the sides. The strip loin, again tasty but over salted. Cauliflower mash was not my taste either. The sea buckthorne mousse could not be described by our waiter.. But it was sour and tart. Like orange meets kumquat. Weird. The texture was also off (for me) for a mousse... Was more like a Panna cotta. So we decided to get a brandy to make things better. The waiter returned with the brandy and tells us they don't have the one we ordered and the one that is better is more expensive so he just picked something that was the same price. And then he walked away before we could even react. I feel like that should have been our choice to make, not his! And yes we were charged for it. RE service: the waiter started out very attentive but as the night went on the service simply went flat. No one checked in to see how our meal was going, whether it was cooked properly or if we wanted anything else. All in all, a very expensive let down.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Place looks underwhelming from outside and inside even but sometimes those are the best places. Food came out quickly and the fish are nicely sized! Once you're done, be sure to walk the area to check out the dozens of varieties of restaurants nearby.","Sentiment":"positive"}

You will be a regular customer once you try this place out.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The thing that makes Fresco stand out amongst other fish and chips shops is that the have gluten free batter as an option which is actually still very pleasant. The fries are top notch delicious. I think they're double fried and are crispy but fluffy all at once. The shrimp were good and all a very consistent in size which was nice. Overall, a good meal. The restaurant itself is cute and has nice decor.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"My partner and I were exploring The Well across the street and decided to stop by Le Select Bistro for some appetizers before we continued to explore the area. The hostesses and our server were very friendly and welcoming. We shared the escargots bourguignons, seared scallops, and smoked whitefish - all very delicious! Very tempted to order French onion soup, but we were pressed for time! Can't wait to come back again to try other items on the menu!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"After a long day at Niagara Falls, we were ready for a nice dinner.  Le S\u00e8lect was on the hotel list, had good reviews, and had a thumbs up from a few people we spoke to.  In addition, it was a short walk from our hotel, just West of the Entertainment District. We started off w\/ the escargots in puff pastry.  This dish tasted good, but there were too many mushrooms for my taste.  It was hard to taste the star of the dish. On the other hand, my main was fantastic.  I haven't had confit for a while, so when I was researching the menu, I had my mind set.  The duck was so crispy, moist and flavorful.   Secondarily, the beans & ham underneath were very hearty.  I'm glad I didn't opt for two pieces of duck. I saved room for dessert, and the pear tartine w\/ ice cream & caramel was perfect for a warm summer night.  It was light, and I love anything w\/ a caramel sauce.  To accompany dessert, I had a nice Canadian whisky. Regarding the ambiance, its big inside & out.  There is a large bar to your right as you walk in.  We opted for the large patio bc it was still warm after .  The only downside was the restroom was a long walk thru the inside, and down a long flight of stairs. Our waitress Becca was excellent.  She was friendly, informative on the menu, and attentive. Le S\u00e9lect is frequented by many locals, and located in a neighborhoody building.  I'm glad we had the chance to have an great meal w\/ excellent service, in a very comfortable setting.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I've been to this resto in a number of incarnations. It was originally on Queen West, then Wellington, then closed and now back on Wellington in its same location. Happy to say that the food is still great. Lovely same decor, French Bistro, with a lot of booths. In summer they have a huge front patio. One thing to note. This block of Wellington from Spadina to Portland is a disaster presently with construction.  We made the mistake of driving and getting there and finding a place to park us nightmarish. You can't even park on one side of the street. So take transit or check out if there is parking available elsewhere. Ok. Now to the food. We did go for lunch not dinner. Hubby had escargot. Then Mussels and Frites. I had the Croque Madame. Pics included. Our friends had the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e at the end and the Salmon Brioche and Fris\u00e9e salad for mains. FYI this is not a place for a rushed meal.  Food was timely but well spaced. Good selections of wine even by the glass. Do give them a try!  Recommend reservations though. The place was packed!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This place lives up to the hype! This tavern is often so packed that it's hard to get a table, but we went late on a weeknight and were so glad that we did! Lamb chops, eggplant dip, side dishes of runner beans and roasted potatoes, and a baklava cheesecake were PERFECT. It was all sharing plates and this was enough to feed . (Especially the generous baklava cheesecake-- definitely share this!) Will definitely come back again!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Went here on a whim when another restaurant was too busy on a Sunday night. We were seated right away in communal high chairs. The food was very mid for what you are paying. The chicken would have been really dry without the sauce. My favorite thing was probably the potatoes which were crispy and well seasoned. The restaurant itself had a very nice vibe to it and the service was nice!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Apparently this is nelly furtado's favorite restaurant in toronto so of course you need to try it right? It is pricy and everyone here knows it. The service is a bit average, they are attentive but I find that it was not the luxury dining experience I had hoped for. Without a reservation they may offer you a spot at the bar or the kitchen. The thing that is unfortunate is that it is really tight and they tried to maximize number of people at a small counter. So for the premium you are paying for food it can feel uncomfortable to have someone's elbow in your way or feel like you will knock over someone's wine at any point. The servers were not that helpful if I had to be honest. If you asked for a recommendation, there are nice of nice staff, but they dont seem too knowledgable about the menu. You can tell they are struggling as they may not know the items well. The food was tasty but honestly not worth the price. $. Was expecting giant meat balls but it was average sized so that would be $7-$ (and they tasted like unseasoned beef). This place is popular for the sake of being hard to get into. Probably wont come back unless I have a sugar daddy to take me","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This place was so good. The food was amazing, so well cooked and reminded me of back home. Not usually a lamb person but the lamb here was like butter. The chicken was so moist and flavourful. My favourite was definitely the calamari. Not breaded like other restaurants just real authentic Greek calamari. The atmosphere feels like you walked into a restaurant in Mykonos. Me and my family had a great time here. Right in the heart of ossington which is a great area for good vibes. The service was great too very fast but i wish they taught their servers how to pronounce tzatziki","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Had a great time eating here, almost everything we had was delicious, great atmosphere and cosy interior, lives the views of the open kitchen. The lamb chops were a highlight, cooked perfectly, tender, and served with a great tzatziki. (4.5\/5) Octopus was better than most, good portion for the price, really well balanced flavours with the sauce and the capers. (4.5\/5) The spinakopita was ridiculously large, the honey was a nice accompaniment. (4\/5) The only complaint i had was for the crudo - Flavors of the shrimp and basil ouils were interesting, but , and two bites had scales, pieces of fin, really soured an otherwise excellent dinner. (1\/5). Service was great, friendly and made good reccomendations aside from the crudo, and the food arrived very quick.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"An aesthetically fancy spot to dine, my friends and I were lucky to walk in and find spots available at the counter. The highlight of this meal was the baklava, absolutely stunning and sweet that makes it a must-get to end your night with a treat! Their grilled octopus was also fantastic, while the lamb neck and chicken was made in nice style to try out. Only con is that it's a bit pricy relative to the portion you get but it is on the higher, fancy end of dining and the atmosphere was bright and buzzing at night. P.S the Tsipouro is a pretty strong drink!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Super cute interior, great service and delicious modern greek cuisine! The restaurant is small and usually booked out, so make sure to make a reservation well in advance. Servers\/ manager were great throughout the night and even helped us with suggestions of what to get for a party of 6! Now onto the food\/ drinks: Moscow Mule 10\/10 - Refreshing, gingery cocktail that complimented the entire meal quite nicely House dips 10\/10 - The highlight was the eggplant one which was amazing and slightly sweet. The dips in general were a great start to the meal and ideal for sharing! Lamb tartare 10\/10 - Another great dish for sharing. The yogurt base was nice and creamy that complimented the tartare quite nicely. Horiatiki 10\/10 - One of the favourite dishes of the night. It's a tomato feta cheese salad. Who would've thought that eating colorful heirloom tomatoes with feta would be such a hit! The salad was bright in colour and flavour, and so refreshing! Top notch quality tomatoes over there! Stifado 10\/10 - Comes with one HUGE short rib that is fall off the bone on a bed of parsnip puree and topped with a gravy like sauce. Deep flavours of beef here which was enjoyed by everyone at the table. MUST GET! Lavraki 9\/10 - A whole grilled sea bass. Comparing this to the short rib, this was definitely on the lighter side with just a squeeze of lemon on it. Still great flavours though and was a nice light option. Tiganites Patates 8\/10 - Crispy potatoes with an herb and feta aioli. You can't go wrong with potatoes and they're always a nice side to have with your meal. Great for sharing! Overall, LOVE LOVE LOVED this restaurant and can't wait to come back for more. Also know that they have a sister restaurant Koukla right beside Mamakas and can't wait to try that one as well!","Sentiment":"positive"}

I introduced my friend who has never tried korean food and he loved it. You can also tell how good a korean place is based on their side dishes and I had to order more. The kimchi and radish kimchi were so good, i could just eat them with plain rice. My friend loved the japchae and i loved the sweet potato side dish. I ordered the suhlungtang and it was so hearty and made with love. The meat was soft and it did not disappoint. Brought me back to life in the cold and rainy day. These soups come with rice!

{"Review Text":"This spot always has a line and we had to stop in to check it out! Upon arrival, you'll join the waitlist by writing your name on a notepad. There were a few parties ahead of us on a Saturday evening, but even more people waiting by the time we left. The space is quite large with booths easily having enough room for ! What we got: - Bulgogi Bibimbap - Tteokbokki - Mul Naengmyun - Seafood Pancake My Favs: - Tteokboki: The rice cakes here were on the sweeter side but still had a kick to them and came with different cuts of rice cake and noodles too - Mul Naengmyun: Slushy broth, chewy noodles, and lots of vinegar Final Thoughts: I found the food pretty vinegar forward which suits my tastes, but may not be for everyone. The banchan, pancake dipping sauce, and cold noodles were all very acidic and since it's made that way you aren't really able to adjust. The portions are pretty good for the price and with a 10% cash discount, all four dishes cost us about $60. I'd definitely come again if the wait isn't too bad!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Wonderful place with incredible food, generous portions, great prices, good service - and it's better than ever at this new location at . We tried to go here on a Saturday night but there was already a pretty big waitlist - too long for our hunger level. We came back on a weekday at around 5:, with just  (we took one). By the time we left, the area between our table and the door and on the street outside was full of eager young diners and groups of hungry student types. We knew we were probably ordering too much, but couldn't resist trying several things. We got the spicy bulgogi on a hot plate ($16), stir fried rice with kimchi in a hot pot (came with an egg but we ordered an extra one by accident ($13 + $2), and the pork bone stew ($12). To drink we had regular soju ($17) and Sapporo (large can, $8). The bulgogi was so tender and so scrumptiously soft and spicy next to the slightly crunchy carrot, bean sprout, and onion melange. Can't wait to have this again! I was also blown away by the pork bone stew, there were so many bones with so much meat, and a huge pile of cabbage, which was lovely and soft and made a nice contrast. I ordered the broth regular spicy and it was lovely - it's not a fatty broth (which could be too satiating next to all that meat), but it's not thin, either. I'll be here for a steaming bowl of this when winter sets in. The rice was excellent - flavourful and saucy - and the crispy edge bits were especially scrumptious. The music was thumping and lots of fun! The tempo created a lively atmosphere and upheld the hungry vibe - people are here to get some seriously yummy food. A standout meal!","Sentiment":"positive"}

When you come in for dine-in make sure to write your name on the waiting list and pay attention for your name to get called by a staff member. Food: All the dishes were great value and tastes yummy! The seafood pancake could have been less charred though. The pork meat from the KamJa Tang was fall off the bone and ideal for cold weather. The stir fried rice cake (tteokbokki) was not too spicy which was nice. Atmosphere\/service: The wait staff are constantly present and moving around and gave good customer service. I liked their seating arrangement, and there are barriers between each table in the same column along the wall.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Coming to this neighborhood always poses the number question; the main question is always where to eat? Is the orange place on the corner. But now there's this Orange place too! The variety of appetizer salads they put on the table in front of you is incredible, and potentially a full meal in itself. The bibimbap is what I came for though, and I left happy. I was expecting a small bowl for $. What I was not expecting but the giant bowl that could have served as breakfast lunch and dinner, perhaps keeping me satiated until lunch the next day? The people I was with were barely able to eat half, and we're more than happy to pack the other half away to have for them later. However, I wanted to enjoy the experience where both the quality of food, the portion size, and the price, was like something I haven't seen in well over a decade. This is definitely a place that I will be thinking about, and yearning to return to.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"A very busy restaurant in the evening. You need to put your name down on their waitlist. Their mul-naengmyeon was good at first, but it was too sour, and the more you ate, the more sour it got. The bulgogoi was good and refreshing as they included lots of cabbage. The service was nice, but wish they had those buttons to call a server because they were rushing back and forth, and it was difficult to get their attention.

Interior is renovated and seating is ALL booths on either side of the restaurant. Yummy Korean Food is a good mix of Value Vs. Taste!  PBS is $10.99, BBB is under $!  PBS tasted more homey, not overly salted, and there was quite a bit of veg on top when it arrived to the table.  It came with white rice as opposed to purple.  BBB Bulgolgi even came with a fried egg on top! ! Could not finish either dish.  There was more than half of the BBB left! Only negatives that I could think of was that it was a bit tricky to get waitress' attention since everyone is seated in a booth.  And K-Pop was on full-blast the whole time.  :)","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"It's always busy except for the odd day they are off. They seat you almost immediately even on their busiest days. Once seated they bring you water and chopsticks etc. once you order, and there are so many options to chose from, they bring you over a few little dishes (banchan) which are a mixture of sweet and spicy little things to eat with or before your meal. My favourite is the potato! No clue what's in the gravy but I could drink it. There's a lot of chatter going on since it mostly always busy, yet you can really tell. You can hear Korean pop music playing and overall it's a fear and quick atmosphere for lunch or dinner!","Sentiment":"negative"}

First came the small dishes of pickled dishes and cold glass noodles and some sort of potato in a gravy? It was so sweet and delicious. Then I got Korean fried rice with beef and kimchi and a fried egg on top. It was a little overwhelming how big the portion was! It was so good though. It's ALWAYS BUSY so either go early or be prepared to wait for about 15-. Once seated, the service is so quick. Like I said, it's always busy so it's not a quiet place to eat.

Kalamari 10\/10 - Can never go wrong with fried kalamari. This was so fresh and portion size was great. Another great dish for sharing. Chicken Souvlaki Dinner 10\/10 - Comes with a chicken souvlaki on a stick, a side salad, rice, roasted potatoes and tzatziki. Super filling and well balanced meal. The chicken souvlaki was especially delicious, tender and paired so well with the tzatziki. Since we got two sides and a souvlaki dinner, we decided to just grab one more stick of chicken souvlaki on the side and share everything for a party of 2. It was more than enough food for the both of us, even had enough for left overs. The service here is quick, but the servers are not the most chatty, friendly people ever. They just toss your dishes onto your table and walk away. Doesn't bother me though, just something I noticed. As long as service is quick and efficient, I'm okay with that!

We were sad to hear that they had not received any of their 'Flown from Greece' fish shipment in the last several years, as we have would've loved to start with some whitings. After some recalibration, we decided to start with the broiled tiger shrimp. Followed by the grilled kalamari dinner and mixed grill platter. The tiger shrimp was a great start, five large pieces swimming in a sauce of Parmesan and white wine. The complementary bread was perfect and soaked up the delicious broth. The grilled calamari was exactly how I liked them. Tender, fresh, with a bit of char flavor. I swiped some grilled lamb chops, and they were amazing also. I loved that are our entrees came with a salad, potatoes, and rice. Very filling dinner!","Sentiment":"positive"}

The serving size of the lamb was very generous for the price. The roast was tender, but I was looking for much more flavor. Having potatoes and rice was somewhat odd, but made for an hearty entree. Nothing great here, but I was totally full. It would be hard to return when there are so many greek restaurants in the area.","Sentiment":"negative"}

{"Review Text":"There was plenty of real crab in the Crab Cakes, but the overwhelming taste was of deep fryer oil. I couldn't taste the crab except to tell it did need more seasoning. How about adding more moisture to the mix and air frying them? The coleslaw had no apple as promised, just oil on sliced cabbage and parsley. There needs to be less oil and better quality oil used, along with some brightness!  And salt! A touch of salt is needed in savoury dishes (and sometimes sweet ones too). Try adding fennel, mustard, a vinegar... The Rodney's Chocolate Mousse was more gooey than mousse-like and a bit too sweet. I haven't been to Rodney's since 2001, and I didn't get oysters, but this was all rather disappointing.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Comparable to progresso soup. Tried a variety of east coast oysters and they were very fresh but not outstanding. Oysters are definitely an acquired taste! I liked the many topping offerings. My favorites were the fresh lemon and cocktail sauce mixed together. The complementary bread and butter served on the table is fresh and delicious! Worth asking for a second serving!!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"The portion sizes were enormous and I think only one of three of us were able to finish mostly everything on their plate. The crab croquettes were so surprisingly good, I could've eaten a lot more than the three I ordered. I'm not a seafood gorlie but admittedly I couldn't taste much if any crab and so I loved it. The sauce overtop was tangy and zesty and perfect. I absolutely loved that they had fish katsu which was friendly for all the pescatarian folks. A lot of the time I can't eat curries or katsus because there's either meat stock in the curry or there's no vegetarian or pescatarian katsu option. Katsuya had me covered. The fish itself was pretty flavorless but didn't care too much because the carbonara sauce was well flavored and had me surprised to find baby shrimps, broccoli florets and red chili flakes inside! It actually had a little hint of spice I was so pleased. I wish there was a little more rice but with the portion already being so huge I bet it would've made it even more challenging to finish.  I understand why they've won Yelp awards!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Honestly, my go-to place for Katsu. They have many different options but I usually go for the original. The service here is absolutely amazing the servers are always so quick and generous. They also offer unlimited rice and salad. The portion sizes are huge! I usually also get their honey butter fries which are super crispy. As for the bathroom, it is usually super clean.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Katsuya used to be one of my go-to places when I was downtown and craving katsu. I haven't been in a few years, but stopped by before a concert recently and it's just as I remembered. What I got: - Japanese Pork Loin Katsu Final Thoughts: The katsu is quite large and crispy while remaining moist inside. The Japanese Katsu is one of the only options without nuts so this is my go-to as I have an allergy. It comes with a tangy dipping sauce, miso soup, cabbage, and rice. I remember the cabbage and soup being refillable for free but I didn't get a refill this visit so I can't say for sure if that is still offered. The salad dressing for the cabbage used to be on the table pre-covid, but now they add it for you before bringing you your food so I found the cabbage quite bitter and underdressed as I used to drench it in sauce aha. Other than the dressing no longer being self-serve, this spot is just as I remembered it! It's a bit pricey coming close to $'t get this regularly but when the craving hits it's a great treat.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I haven't tried many katsu restaurants so I can't really compare but Katsuya has some pretty good katsu! Their menu selection is large with different types of \"sauces\" such as their house sauce, mayo flavours, garlic sweet chilli, Japanese style, and more. They even have katsu stuffed with cheese! They have a selection of appetizers to choose from as well. Their katsu dishes also come with a side of soup, it is normally miso soup but due to low supply chain they replaced it with udon broth. It had a nice bonito dashi flavour and completes your meal! They also offer free refills on the soup if you would like more to wash down your katsu. My go to order is usually their Japanese style Katsu with pork loin. The katsu pieces are cooked well with a crispy batter outside but the meat is still quite juicy on the inside. Their dipping sauce is on the side so you can dip as much as you prefer. They also provide a small bowl of sesame seeds to ground up and add to your dish as well. The whole set comes with ginger, yellow pickled radish, shredded cabbage to cut the grease and a bowl of rice. The portion size is big so I was full by the end of my meal. Staff here are really friendly and service was quick and efficient. They also offer a 10% discount if you pay with cash. I'd come back here if I ever crave katsu! Convenient location across TMU university.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Delicious!!!! A place full of amazing Katsu! Just Yumm. I've got delivery from here and some dine in. Chicken katsu: perfect! Perfectly crispy, crunchy, moist. Just all around balanced meal with their sauce. The pork katsu carbonara: delicious twist! Takoyaki! Yummmm! I'm not the first person to order takoyaki but they sure make it well here. And the curry katsu! The curry is definitely the star. So good, can't wait to return and dine in so I get the crispiest and crunchiest Katsus!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I wish I could get this restaurant . It is so fantastically delicious. I was lucky enough to actually go here when opened. I believe it was actually the opening night. I often bring people who I know are also foodies to this restaurant to introduce them to this amazing food. We had dinner for two. We chose ribs and brisket. You can actually choose three items but I happen to know the brisket is crazy good. We also got the macaroni and cheese and the broccolini. Everything was so good. We barely even spoke to one another. I was so excited about the food I didn't even take a single picture. It was really lovely to be able to sit out on the patio. They have done such a lovely job creating a beautiful atmosphere. I was also impressed that the server let us know that we need not tipped because they make fair market wages (we still left a tenner). This restaurant is definitely my number one and Roncy.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Came here on a whim and was shocked by their pricing. Everything seemed overly priced. The service was great and it had a nice cozy vibe. A half pound of beef brisket for $32, this better be the best brisket I've ever put in my mouth.....and it was! It was super tender, perfect amount of fatness. Their classic barbecue sauce was also delicious. A great balance, not too sweet or smokey. 5\/, and this is my personal favourite. I already love corn bread but they just totally elevated it by grilling it and also by adding real corn, herbs and butter on it! 5\/, their Mac and cheese was very cheesy, and I also enjoy the crispy topping on top! 4\/, we had to get some green. Opted for their grilled garlic gai lan. It had interesting flavours but for $.... I would skip it. 3\/5. It wasn't until we went to pay for the bill where we realized this is one of those no tipping restaurant... now it all make sense. Overall, I recommend this spot for some bomb barbecue meat!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I'm in love with a sandwich. There are many reasons to come here. Obviously for the food. Went here twice for lunch and had the brisket sandwich. Twice. It's yummy and slightly sweet with a bit of smoke. The service is fantastic we had two different people each visit and the service is friendly, strong and consistent.  Last but not least they are paid a living wage so tips are optional. I generally hate high top tables but I was perfectly comfortable on my second visit with the retro chairs and the high top. It's a roadhouse ambience and comfortably casual. Don't miss this place. It's awesome.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We ordered the chicken tenders, smoked beef brisket, and piri piri grilled carrots and broccoli. The chicken tenders were very crispy, as they are panko crusted. They were delicious and I would definitely recommend. The carrots and broccoli were also nicely seasoned and came in a generous portion. It was topped with cashews, which are a nice touch. However, the brisket was a bit of a disappointment. At $, it's fairly pricey so I had high expectations. I was pretty disappointed - the cut of meat wasn't fatty enough and overall the brisket was a bit dry. I've had briskets from BBQ places across the city and this is probably among the worst one I've had, while also being the most expensive. The service was great and the waiter was extremely attentive - I spilled a bit of sauce on my shirt and he noticed and immediately brought over a Tide to Go! This restaurant also pays their employees a fair wage so tips are not necessary. I do appreciate that a lot. Overall the food was okay - interestingly the smoked meat itself was a disappointment but everything else was good. The service was lovely. If I'm ever in the area I might give this place another try.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Scattered thoughts about this place. Atmosphere is great. Definitely a high-end BBQ spot right when you walk in. Ordered the Sampler for Two (96) where we chose the Caesar Salad, Chicken Thigh, Farmer's Sausage, Baby Back Ribs, Mac N' Cheese and Collard Greens. The highlight for me was probably the Mac N' Cheese and Farmer Sausage. Both were done quite nicely. Great flavours on the sausage. The chicken and ribs were just ok. Surprisingly dry ribs which was disappointing. Great service, very attentive and they are one of the few no-tip restaurants around. I had pretty high expectations given the price and while its pretty expensive, I think it's still a nice, intimate spot overall.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"If you're in the area and want to have some barbecue, this is the spot to go! Ambiance - 4\/5 - nice vibe to come with a friend or two and have some barbecue! Service - 5\/5. Our server was very sweet and checked up on us a lot, had a nice smile and really just made me leave the night saying, \"she was so nice and had such great service\"! What was also noteworthy is that tip isn't required at this restaurant - the machine doesn't even have the option. Although, the food is a bit pricey, so that probably makes up for the no tip, as the servers are paid full wages. Food: Overall - 4\/ - 3\/5. Tasted good, but nothing I'd say you must order. Beef brisket - 4\/5. Tasty and soft, with a nice sauce. Would recommend it!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Every time I've been to The Wren it's been for either a tap takeover or part of a pub\/bar crawl.  I recently found myself there for yet another tap takeover, so I figure it's about time I reviewed the venue.  The Wren is small and not particularly upscale (except for the washroom).  It does, however, boast both a great beer selection and great food.  It's also in a convenient location, being not too far east of Greenwood subway station and also nearby a number of other bars, etc. As I've only been to the venue for the aforementioned special Events, it's always been or became quite crowded while I was there but I can't recall service - either at the bar or tables - having ever been quite negatively impacted as a result.  Due to its size, I don't recommend The Wren for large(r) Groups unless you can snag at least .  The noise level, predictably does become quite high when the place is pretty crowded. I definitely recommend The Wren if you haven't been and find yourself in the neighbourhood.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Casual and comfortable, with an extensive drink offering and simple yet great food. Stopped by The Wren for lunch and got: - Big Ol' BBQ Bowl: I'm not exaggerating when I say this might be one of the best pub dishes I've had in the city. The pork belly is tender, the soda pop sauce gives it a delightful sweet\/savoury taste, and the side picnic salad adds a freshness to dish. Definitely try this! - Bulgogi Kimcheeseburger Burger: Pretty good, though seemed a bit like other good cheeseburgers. Would have liked more of the bulgogi and kimchi slaw. - Chocolate Stout Cake: Great end to the meal. The cake itself was a tad dry but the side dulce de leche and whipped cream complemented it really well. Overall, can see why this is a popular pub (and I don't even drink). Will be back for more of their food!","Sentiment":"positive"}

It's casual atmosphere serving comfort food, so it's a nice place to relax a bit after a long workday! They have a good selection of craft beers, and the cocktail is quite decent too! The burger was a pleasant surprise! It's a veggie burger (can't remember its name) that was recommended by our server. I was hesitant at first (since I rarely chose veggie burger), and I'm glad I listened!  The flavor is well balanced - refreshing on one hand, and rich at the same time.","Sentiment":"positive"}

It's not a large place and has a wonderful homey feel. We had the burgers, wings, and mozzarella cheese sticks and they were all outstanding. No pre-made or frozen stuff here.

{"Review Text":"My friend and I came here this past Thursday night around . They got seated and a line formed behind us. Everyone was running around with their heads cut off (which I get I've worked in the industry for over ) yet none of them maintained the hospitable know-how to be friendly or acknowledge us at the door (key importance in service) or be aware of how they were coming across or what was happening in the line. Literally to my shock the guy who was unbelievably bitchy when I asked why he was coming to the door and asking everyone BEHIND us \"how many?\" and somewhat attempting to seat them, literally skipping over us two in the front. It was so confusing and shocking, I began to think he was being racist since my friend is Chinese, no joke, it was so blatant. When I asked why he wasn't even looking at us let alone greeting us or asking about our party, he was so inappropriate and bitchy, saying things like \"I'm facilitating the situation honey\" I was shocked. After about , we finally were seated as I spoke up a couple times while getting anxious while my confusion continued, while I said to him walking to the table that I am not the one being rude, we never got acknowledged then when I questioned his method of 'attending' to the door, he was brutally sarcastic and rude. He continued with remarks and left. We sat and waited of course about . Took us long enough to abandon that sinking ship.

{"Review Text":"Always interested to see what new beers come out of Bellwoods Brewery. We dropped in on an early Tuesday evening (around 5:00pm). There was a small queue when we arrived. There's a couple menu sheets; dinner, draught, wine, cider, reserve bottles and non-alcoholic options. Not sure why they don't state on the menu that 4oz beer samples are offered. - Sparkly water ($3.) - raspberry and lemon. Very carbonated. Light in flavour. - Pink grapefruit radler ($4.00) - decent but found it unbalanced. - White picket fence ($4.00) - blended foeder saison. Had a barrel aged, wine-like flavour. - Jelly King peach, orange & grapefruit ($4.50) - this was B's favourite. I found the grapefruit overpowered the other two fruits. - Jelly King raspberry & peach ($4.50) - my favourite from the four tasters. Refreshing and juicy. - Jelly Royale mango lassi ($8.00) - grabbed a can from the bottle shop to try. Tasted like an alcoholic mango lassi. Good thickness. Keep an eye out for their other smoothie sours. Wish BB had more of their sour beer offerings to sample.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"While walking around Ossington, I stumbled upon a few people buying bottles to go at Bellwoods Brewery. I changed up our plans for dinner and decided to head there for a quick snack and drink. We dropped in on a Tuesday (around 5:45pm) and the place was packed. We had to wait in line for about . The patio was bumping; get their early if you want a seat there. They have a cool setup; the patio and bar is to the left, retail (bottles and merchandise) are to the right. The inside has a mix of tables and bar stool seating. Service was friendly and they topped are waters several times. The retail area had  (ranged from $5. $10.). There was also some merchandise (t-shirts, hoodies and beer glasses). The dinner menu is small for food; small plates, large plates and sweets. There was  & bottles (ciders too). Oddly, they don't have flights and limit you to two 4oz samples per person. - Pineapple + blueberry jelly king ($2.) - this was a fruited dry-hopped sour. Really tart and sour, just the way I like it! Easily would get a full pint of this. - Burdock t\u00e9 ($2.) - this was a guest sour that wasn't on their beer list. Much more citrusy; tones of mandarin orange and lemon. Another solid sour. - Garlic fries ($8.00) - herbs and a side of garlic mayo. Our waitress kindly brought us some ketchup too. Pretty good although a few fries could have been crispier. Sweet brewery find! Chill on the patio or grab a few bottles to go for the park nearby. Jelly king was bomb.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"After taking over the space next door and seeming to go more upscale than in the past, Bellwoods has a new menu. It's very good, and a good option for a dinner out, even if you don't want to eat pub food. Chicken liver mousse was flavourful and well-matched with a fruit compote and crispy onions. Braised beef cheek was tender, with deep-dark umami flavour perfect for a winter night. Slightly less successful was the sauteed garlic shrimp which, although tasty, did not have a lot of garlic flavour. For a brewery, I do wish they had  a little more variety in the beer styles on tap. While they have a number of different options, their list is dominated by high-alcohol cloudy IPA's and sours.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Fantastic beer, delicious food, relaxing ambiance (speaking more to my recent, winter and spring month experiences, sitting inside, upstairs). This is the very first choice when thirst and hungry strike at the same time. The inside looks tiny here, but there is an area upstairs that overlooks the front of the restaurant and the back brewing area. Service is always great up there even though you feel like you're tucked away in your own private alcove. The beer list changes a fair bit and I appreciate the detailed descriptions on their menu card. I've tended towards trying the IPAs and have loved them all. While Bellwoods gets a standing ovation for its beer, the food has to be applauded loud and long. This is not just a brewery with food, these are really well thought out and well prepared beer accompaniments. I wouldn't be surprised if people come here for grub who don't order beer. Me and my DC have mostly always ordered the same items on every visit and they've been consistently excellent - the kale and ryeberry salad, the duck meatballs - sometimes the fries, and the corn cobs when they're available... all are unique in their own way. We tried the queso fundido last time - surprisingly scoopable and so decadent with the chicharrones. Portion sizes are spot on. We've only really had one food \"miss\" here - the smoked bratwurst (which seems to have disappeared the lamb sausage with fennel curry, which we really loved). It is difficult to eat and not worth $14. Everything else on the menu is elevated though it's pretty simple fare, and this one seems a spin on the, IMO, now-overly-prevalent genre of fancy-not-fancy junk food.","Sentiment":"positive"}

A great selection of craft beers and totally delectable Smokey duck hearts that you could lick the plate clean for the sauce alone. Order two skewers because you won't be able to just eat one. Choice picks: -Bellweiser if you like wheaty beers - Jutsu for something hoppy and bitter - grissette is a lower alcohol (3.9%) but sour alternative - jelly king for a serious sour","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"It's always nice to be able to review a place you have visited many times over a period of time and give it a full five stars. And I think we have been here enough to earn the right to this full-throated endorsement. We've had beers here on a hot summer afternoon on the packed patio, as less lucky wanna-be patrons stood in line, tongues hanging out panting and eying our cold beverages with a combination of jealousy and barely concealed hate. We've been here on a chilled but sunny November afternoon for a last of the year outdoor pint when we were the only ones brave enough to do so. We watched as a cavalcade of youth, clad in their  Goose jackets, hurried inside out of the 'cold'. We sneered, mocking their youth with the only thing we have left at our age, true grit. And over this past winter we have, more and more, just rolled in for a bite to eat and a hoppy glass of suds. And of our samplings the food here has been a cut above the rest. Way beyond the burger and fries pub grub that gets slung around in this town and more substantial and less precious than some upscale bars, Bellwoods strikes a nice balance. Favorites are the Rye Berry Salad, Duck Meatballs (they come with a fresh and tangy tomato sauce), and seasonally last year, grilled corn on the cob. Just yesterday we also tried the Queso Fundido, which as a decadent dipper (fluffy crispy chicharrones), was a real treat. Plus the fries here are really great - and they get to you hot - which is an important but sometimes overlooked detail. We like a good IPA and they always have a couple on the beer menu. So far we have really enjoyed them all. Last night RUNES became a new favorite. The brewery seems to like innovating and pushing the flavors of their beers, without getting silly or being self-consciously sensationalist. So beer... YAY! The staff has always been very friendly and the service is great. One of the first times I went here it did seem somewhat chaotic but it was a super busy afternoon and I have not seen this happen again since. The only drawback is that this is a popular spot, especially now that the weather is warming up. I guess if the patio is full you can always get a six pack at the bottle shop and take the party elsewhere but the place is fun and worth a few minutes in line.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Came here with a friend having Korean food for the first time! We had an awesome meal! It was a long awaited catch up sesh during lunch. I personally think bulgogi is the way to go for a newbie. I was correct! Great portion of beef, noodles, and mushrooms. The banchan was plentiful. A large variety of sides. We did not leave hungry, that's for sure! Service was attentive and accommodating. I'd definitely come back for dinner. So many meats to choose from!","Sentiment":"positive"}

We got , the meat was high quality and tender and mushrooms were fresh. It also came with free sides dishes as well as garlic, cheese corn, kimchi, and egg. We also got some complimentary tofu stew which was delicious and went well with the rest of the food. The ambiance is like other Korean bars- loud and lively! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to have a few drinks or soju over dinner with some good Korean BBQ.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"DECENT GREEK CUISINE AT DANFORTH After reading many great reviews about this place, we decided to give it a try during a weekday night.  We went early so we got a table without waiting, although the place was packed shortly afterward. We ordered the Octopus Skaras (grilled octopus) and the Grill Mix (chicken, lamb, and sausage).  The octopus dish was quite good - tender and nicely marinated.  The Grill Mix though, gave us a \"mixed feeling\".  We like the lamb chop the most!  The sausage is decent, but the chicken breast certainly has rooms for improvement.  It was overcooked and quite dry. The service was good overall and our server was quite responsive.  It was a full-house that night, so we felt they were rushing a bit at times (just a little bit) but that's understandable.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This restaurant is just as good as I remember it. I used to come here with my family because we loved the food so much. I haven't been in a few years, but not much has changed. I made reservations online for 7:45pm on a Tuesday, but ended up being really early. They happened to be able to seat us within 10-15mins which was nice. It was the first Tuesday after New Year's and it was raining, so I thought it would be quiet. It was quite the opposite. It was really busy! We ordered the mousaka and grilled calamari (main dish size). The mousaka was heavenly. It's my favourite thing to get here. The grilled calamari was also delicious. It came with three large pieces. We had enough for leftovers, being two people. The dessert was also such a nice touch! Service was excellent. We always had our waters topped up and was attended to quite frequently. All staff were very friendly. I've missed this place and can't wait to be back!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Enjoyed it for the most part. The staple of Greek food is either souvlaki or gyros wit Tzatziki and I had neither. I went with a seafood dish instead and it was moist and felt fresh. The prawn was large and well grilled, the orange roughy deliciously done (and orange!) and calamari again tasty and not rubbery or dry. Well done. The side of rice was fine too, but the accompanying beans were strongy and dry. The beans were very likely out of a frozen bag. They served complimentary boring white bread and butter to start. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing special or fancy there. The menu has souvlaki, fish, soups, family trays and plenty of alcohol. The service was polite and attentive. The waiter was friendly and the hostess polite and welcoming. Prices were average, the setting was a little crowded and close-quarters, but it is summer and they have a patio I would recommend. Washroom was not the cleanest, but okay. This is billed as authentic Greek - the type of place where they let the flame loose and yell 'opa ' - and I think it lived up to that billing. I would say that I would be happy to go back and order a' meat and potato' souvlaki here. Speaking of billing, did not enjoy being prompted for ridiculous amounts for tips. Firstly, tipping (lying about prices) should be banished. The service was fine, but post your price and just your price. Secondly, I am sick of all these asks for 15%, 18%, 20%, 25% etc on top of the posted price. Businesses should stop being coy and just prompt for 200% tip. That would help the bottom-line even more, right? .","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We dropped by this place on a nice warm evening. Got patio seating. It was perfect atmosphere. We got greeted with water and bread. The bread was honestly unnecessary and slightly disappointing. I'd personally prefer a pita over bread. But the rest of the meal did not disappoint! I ordered a small chicken souvlaki dinner. You get a Greek salad on side before the main comes out. The meat was perfectly tender. Lots of great flavours in this meal. My husband got jumbo shrimp meal. The shrimp was nice and saucy, came served with some veggies and on top of rice with mushrooms. At the end of the meal, we got a complimentary piece of cake. It had juicy honey flavour to it, but not soggy. It was really a pleasant surprise to top our meal. The servers were super nice and welcoming. I'd defiantly come back here for another dinner.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Finally got around to trying this stalwart of the Danforth Greek scene. The interior is no frills and the ambience definitely reminded me of being back in Greece at a family-owned taverna -- the music probably contributed to that. Unfortunately, the sea smelt were not in season so I opted for the grilled chicken skewer, which had nice flavour. We all shared the dip platter, which came with , warm pita and some marinated octopus. All quite tasty. I particularly liked the tzatziki and tirokafteri (spicy feta spread). Personally, I wasn't a fan of the gigantes (Greek baked beans) but absolutely loved the pickled beets. The horiatiki salad (Greek salad without the lettuce) was fresh. Others at the table enjoyed the grilled sausage and the lamb. Basically, if you're craving Greek, this is a good bet.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The staff was not only professional but also incredibly warm and welcoming, making us feel like cherished guests from the moment we walked in. Now, let's talk about the food - it was simply outstanding. Each dish we ordered was a masterpiece of flavor and presentation. From the appetizers to the dessert, every bite was a culinary delight. The chef's attention to detail and commitment to quality ingredients were evident in every dish. And the location! It's a charming spot that adds to the overall ambiance. We were lucky enough to dine on the outdoor patio, which offered a lovely view and a serene atmosphere. It's the perfect place to celebrate with friends and family, whether it's a special occasion or just a casual get-together. I can't recommend this restaurant enough.

It is a bit steep in price and there was only a scoop of guacamole and salsa on mine, which is a shame because that charred corn was so flavourful with that smokey charred flavour. You can choose your meats, and I was feeling brisket. Highly recommend the brisket as it really was nice and tender, not tough at all even with the minimal fat. The bbq sauce was well incorporated into the meat, and so juicy. Will love to come back for the burger and other BBQ meats to see how they compare! Lots of hearty meals to choose from. Waffle sweet potato fries were nice, but won't recommend if you're having delivery as they get cold and hard quite fast.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We made a reservation, not sure they take one for only 2, but we didn't want to make the long drive for my husband and not be able to get it, it can get very busy. My husband always like to ask \"how are you\" when he calls, he worked in restaurants when he was young, so he likes to great, and treat people with respect.  The woman answered, YOU called us.  So we made the reservation. They gave us a very small table at the back next to a large group with very loud screaming children. Wow.  We asked for another table as we were ordering a large patter, the platter is the size of the table, no trim for beverages etc.  the woman was rude, said this was it, no more tables.  Not true, they mark the tables that are reserved, she  just didn't want to give us a larger table.  My husband was pissed about the attitude, he wanted yo walk out.  This is a man who has almost never had a bad day and is always happy. So we sat and ordered. I didn't want to go anywhere else after the long drive. We order  from the waitress, she looks and says, that won't fit in the table, you need a bigger table. We get the table at the back used for prep, which is fine, it's bigger and I don't have a screeching child beside me. The food was amazing.  I miss the platter that had chicken.  But my husband really enjoys the BBQ sauce. He misses the additional sauces that used to be on the table.  The spicy was good.  The chicken was tender and moist, no idea how they do that so well. Seemed like some very generous amounts of brisket.  We had tons to take home.  We love the leftovers from Stack.  They taste even better the next day.

We got lucky as seating is tight and they were able to seat us. They did tell us that there was a reservation in a little over an hour but it was more than enough time for us to enjoy our meal. The staff doesn't communicate well with each other because after we were seated someone else asked if we were supposed to be there as if we would come in and seat ourselves, it was odd to say the least. I cant say much about the bar because i was never served my drink but I will talk food. The food was well worth the awkwardness! We did a sampler plate that had three meats and three sides.

{"Review Text":"I came here years ago and forgot how good it was. I didn't come back until now bc they're on the expensive side at an average of around $, however now that inflation has made everything else this price it's kind of averaging out although it's still more expensive than many other places. I was also a new grad when I first tried them out so it felt even more expensive back then. The flavours are delicious, bright, and complex. I see some ppl didn't like the crispy pork belly but I think it might be because they ordered it as takeout. We had it in the restaurant and it was sooo crispy and delicious. However bc it's fried pork belly, if it were to be covered in a takeout container or if it were to get cold I can imagine that some parts will become very hard (the skin part of the pork) and other parts will become too chewy. My opinion is that I don't think their crispy pork series should be ordered for delivery or takeout bc it's not meant to taste like that. We had the pad si ew chicken $18.95 - loved the flavour and the texture of the noodles, the basil moo krob with fried egg (crispy pork belly) $20, and the Nua toon (beef in soup) $25 - the beef was super tender and the soup was delicious. I was also curious abt their green tea Thai iced tea ($6.25) - it was pretty good, taste just as strong as the red tea version but with jasmine tea fragrance. I definitely recommend a visit and I would come back to try more of their dishes.","Sentiment":"positive"}

It's one of the few places that has an amazing Tom yum fried rice I've been looking for! Great Pad Thai and a Green Tea Thai Iced Tea option. Strangely, I seem to be allergic to regular Thai Iced tea which uses Black tea. I typically enjoy them, but my stomach does not. My last visit just the other day, along with the Tom yum fried rice and GT Iced Tea, my partner and I ordered the Fried Chicken dumplings and the Soft Shell Crab Pad Thai, delicious!

We ordered the Combination Soon Tofu with beef, shrimp, and mussel. The tofu was silky smooth, and the addition of the seafood provided a delightful burst of flavours. To top it off, the hot stone pot rice that came with it was the perfect accompaniment, adding a comforting touch to the meal. It truly hit the spot and satisfied our craving for a hot and hearty soup. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm smiles and prompt service.

The quick and efficient service added to the overall positive experience. Foods we tried: We indulged in Kimchi Soon Tofu, Bulgogi Soup, and Blazing Chicken Fire with Fried Rice.

{"Review Text":". It's been a while since I've been here. We managed to walk in and get a seat quite quickly. Decided to try the pork bone soup. The proportions for pork bone are well worth the money; however, I think this needs to be tweaked. Was not very flavourful-- overpowered with gochugaru and not a balance with gochujang. Meat felt slightly cold when it was given to me. Rice could be slightly less moist. Side dishes were good. For $17, not a bad place but would go back for tofu soup perhaps to give this place another try. FYI no more 10% off if you pay with cash -- only applies to takeout only.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The service was quick and they give you free banchan refills. Hubby's bipbambop was good but he felt the egg was mass cooked and cut to adorn the top of his dish. My tofu soondubu came in various heat: none, mild, medium,  and extra spicy. While I chose mild, it still has a lot of heat. For both our entrees, the flavors truly married together in the best way possible. Not one ingredient overwhelmed the other. At the end of my dish, they filled it up and I was able to scrape off the residual crisps from the rice and enjoy it further with additional banchans.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I love the hot stone pot rice that comes with it; it's a nice addition + portion & it's also purple rice! I wish that they would instead of pouring water into the pot rice pour hot tea instead though. In terms of the gamjatang (pork bone soup) I find that The Owl's version is bigger and better. Stick to the soondubus here! Service is fast & the two young male employees I always see are diligent & super hardworking.

They also ask for a contact person in your group for contact tracing if that is needed which is great. I got the kimchi soondubu with beef and I wanted it to be extra spicy! It came with an egg on the side and the hot pot purple rice. The soondubu came out pretty quickly and it was really good! There was an abundance of tofu and the amount of meat was just right for me. I love when the soup is just bubbling goodness and super duper hot! The reason why I didn't rate it 's okay. I also asked it for extra spicy but it wasn't even mild for me. I guess I built my heat tolerance but they use gochugaru for spice level so it's not that spicy. One note is that they don't maintain physical distancing measures in the restaurant. Around 7pm, the entire restaurant was packed and all but two tables were filled. This meant parties were sitting almost nearly an arm's length from each other. Based on regulations, there should still be 6ft physical distancing measures. Service was quick and straightforward. They couldn't split our bill because they were too busy which I understand.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I saw this restaurant featured in an episode of Kim's Convenience (season 1) and ever since then, I've wanted to try it. I ordered the most popular dish combination soon tofu and dolsotbab with beef, shrimp, and mussel. The stew came with a few slices of pork, one mussel, one unpeeled shrimp, and an ABUNDANCE of tofu. It also came with a hot stone pot of purple rice which was scooped into our bowls by the server. The server then poured water into the hot stone pot and left it soaking on our tables. I was unsure if there was a purpose or they wanted to grab all the dirty dishes together. Puzzled, we ate with soaking wet rice on our side. The stew was okay, the soup wasn't too rich in flavour. Maybe it was because I didn't ask for it too spicy. It also came with an egg on the side you crack yourself into the stew which is pretty cool. I love rich stew and the soon tofu wasn't the greatest for me. I hope their other dishes have promise and I believe they do based on the number of customers.

Literally seasoned so well. The portions are filling. My only regret is not getting more. The space is small and you kinda have to fight for a table, but tbh idc bc the tacos make up for it. Every time I crave tacos I wish I had this place near me.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Seven lives is very nostalgic to me. I've been going since its conception in . Back then, these tacos felt like a splurge, but oh so worth it. There's not a lot of room inside - for sitting there's probably space for 4-. If you happen to grab a space to put down your food, you're probably going to stand. If there's good weather, you can indulge outside. The limited space makes it feel cozy in a way. I fondly recall busy nights standing in a corner with a group of friends bonding over tacos. I've tried all their tacos but my fave by far is the gobernador - smoked blue marlin, grilled shrimp, cheese, crema with pickled onions. A close second is the Baja fish - battered and fried fish, cabbage, Baja sauce, and pico de gallo. The tacos come with its own set of toppings but you can top with salsa with your preference of heat - the mild and medium are my usual. Their spiciest is truly spicy so keep that in mind! My brave friend loves spice and although she could handle it, she said it burned away most of the taco taste so that was less enjoyable lol. If it's not clear yet, I LOVE SEVEN LIVES and if you haven't gone, you haven't lived. Seven lives truly deserves its high rating and I hope it stays around forever.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"You cannot go too wrong with tacos, but this was underwhelming. Expect a long, semi disorganized line to order and then a long, disorganized wait for your food. They were sold out of stuff when we got there at 2:. Oddly, they sell guacamole but it does not come with chips.  What's the point? Standing room only to eat there (no seats) and the tacos were nothing special. I don't get the popularity.","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"We were super stuffed from trying food all day at Kensington Market but wanted to give this taco spot a try after getting a recommendation from a friend. It's hard to give a representative rating since we only tried , but from what we tried (Gobernador which had smoked tuna, shrimp, and cheese), it was pretty good! The tacos are HUGE, about the size of your hand. You'd probably get full off of . Just wished they layered the taco with another taco shell since there was so much juice, once I lifted up the taco all the contents were falling out from the bottom and sides. The ingredients were all yummy and I liked how the cheese was still melted by the time it got out to us. The only thing is that on a hot day, this spot does not have much AC so it gets very hot inside and the wait time was pretty long for us.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Amazing tacos in Kensington Market. The service was fast, but does get a bit busy with the lunch crowd so be sure to get there early! The ambiance is fun and lively with music blasting. We ordered the Baja fish and the shrimp Diablo. The Baja fish was refreshing and delicious! The shrimp has a bit of a kick but could do with something crunchy like a slaw to cut the creaminess in my opinion. Tacos are -! Highly recommend!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Located in Kensington Market, Seven Lives has a casual atmosphere and fits right in with the chill vibe of the neighbourhood. It's a self service restaurant with no seating, but has some wooden standing tables at the store front for you to enjoy your food in the restaurant. It takes about , but it's definitely worth the wait. Though I find the tacos here a bit messy to eat (keep lots of napkins handy), they're flavourful and has good balance of ingredients. There's also a good selection of different types of tacos to choose from.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The owner came to say hello and explained that the restaurant started with her late husband who had a passion of cooking and hosting and that she wanted to continue his passion. We got the bomba pizza which tasty, a little oily from the sausage, and the crust was nice and fluffy. The risotto was perfectly cooked, the mushrooms brought so much flavour and it was topped with a generous sprinkle of parmigiana. And we finished it off with a tiramisu which was light and fluffy and the perfect was to end our meal.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Ordered the Funghi Saltati (22) - a mushroom appetizer with brie cheese and the Spaghetti Di Mare Alla Mario (28) - squid\/clam based spaghetti. I thought both were decent dishes, but I would've liked a bit more from the spaghetti. It just felt like there were far too many clams than anything else so it was just clams and spaghetti noodles. The mushroom appetizer was pretty good, I liked the brie but there was only a bit of it hidden in the middle of the dish. The food itself was probably a 3.. Felt very nice and service was good. There's a ton of italian places downtown but most don't open past !","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I've eaten here a few times and find the food is consistently awesome. The pancakes are always my favourite and no matter what I order I need to have at least one as a side. Recently I brought my spouse here on a Saturday. I was so pleased that Mildred's allowed us to make a reservation as my spouse is disabled and can't manage being out for a prolonged period of time. The staff were so kind and helpful and the Manager (Ian), whom I booked the reservation with, made a point of coming over to say hello and made sure we had everything we needed. It really made our visit so much better as we were a larger group and it was pretty busy. I can't thank the staff enough for how wonderful they were. I have requested accommodations elsewhere in the past and had always been refused. Thank you Mildred's for restoring my faith in humanity!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"The wait is long but I think it's worth trying Mildred's at least once. We put our name on the waitlist when we got to the restaurant and they texted us when they were about to have some space. I think that took around . The restaurant itself was really pretty, we loved the high ceilings and the decor at the front, but it seemed like the back portion of it just turned into a storage area for random stuff. The blueberry pancakes are what you come here for. I don't like pancakes, but I ordered them and I loved them so much. I think they were worth the wait. They are, without a doubt, the best pancakes I've ever had. The portion size is insane, three huge pancakes is way too much for one. My friend and I split our orders and we could barely finish these! We also ordered Veda's choice, which was essentially smoked salmon eggs benny on a croissant. Classic. So good, highly recommend. Our server was super professional and really nice! We had a great time. Highly recommend to make the trek at least once!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Are the pancakes thick and delicious? Yes. Was it worth the almost ? Probably not. A group of friends and I came for brunch during the weekend, and since they don't do weekend reservations we waited in line. We ended up waiting for around , then when it was time to order it took another . Though the wait was long, the staff were very nice and helpful. Ok now for the food. Their pancakes are known to be almost crumpet-like, with a thick texture compared to regular pancakes. While they are delicious, the cost was a bit too steep for the amount you get ($). Overall, it was nice trying the food here, but I probably wouldn't opt to do their weekend brunch again.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Their outdoor seatings are not available anymore since bees love the pancake too. We didn't want to wait so get to bar seats which is very comfortable too. The service at the bar also very fast. The pancake, HUGE. It's very fluffy (not Japanese souffl\u00e9 fluffy, but good enough) you don't even need the maple syrup it's already soaked in blueberry jam. It comes in . Recommend to order . The orange juice is so tiny , don't recommend for that price . The Manhandler is perfectly cooked, only complain is lack of seasoning on both steak and salad.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"One of my friends really wanted to check out Mildred's Temple Kitchen while we were exploring the GTA area because he has seen their famous blueberry biscuits on Youtube videos by his favorite celebrity chefs. And if you've seen the pictures, you already know they look scrumptious. We made a reservation in advance for this past Monday late morning, which was a good choice because it was pretty packed. They have a display of items you can buy, including their pancake mix, blueberry compote, maple syrup, and more! Definitely check it out because my friends brought multiple items to bring home. Since it was peak summer, there's a lot of wasps flying around and they tend to come inside pretty easily. There was one that was flying around our table and being a menace, so it was not a fun experience. Other than that, everything was good. HAND CUT FRITES WITH SIDE GARLIC AIOLI - . They were seasoned well and were great on their own. But the garlic aioli was also phenomenal, full of garlic flavor and extremely creamy. I wasn't sure what to do because both options were good. I'd recommend these fries. MRS. BIEDERHOF'S WILD BLUEBERRY BUTTERMILK PANCAKES - 't know who Mrs. Biederhof is, but the presentation of these pancakes were crazy. There were three pancakes - beautiful, super thick and fluffy, with a generous amount of blueberry compote and whipped cream on top. There's also maple syrup drizzled on the slide. The first bite of everything was great. You get a strong blueberry flavor, mixed with the thicccc pancakes that were pretty buttery and hints of the maple syrup that seeps through the pancake. However, if you're not a sweet tooth, the pancakes does become too heavy after a few more bites. The blueberry compote is extremely sweet. The pancakes on their own felt more like biscuits to me because of how dense they are and they're on the drier side. This is a very carb and sugar heavy meal that became way too much for me after a couple bites. If you aren't a big sweet tooth but you still want to try the pancakes, they do sell a single blueberry pancake for $. One of my friends got that and he enjoyed the single pancake he had (and I wish I did the same). Another friend got the Veda's Choice and enjoyed the savory croissant with toppings and the light side salad.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"When I saw \"b'lunch,\" it was a no brainer that I had to go to this restaurant! Brunch on a weekday is what we have all been needing!! The vibe was so relaxed and modern. For a weekday, it was surprisingly lively. We started off with Wally's Cheesy Savoury Tart. The tart was baked to perfection with caramelized onions and cherry tomatoes. It was a good segue to Mrs. Biederhof's Wild Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes. Not only are these pancakes picture-perfect, but they are literally so soft, pillowy, and fluffy. No matter how full I got, I couldn't stop poking my spoon into the whipped cream with maple syrup. I loved these so much... I even bought the pancake mix! Our server was phenomenal.

We were lucky and there were no lines and we were able to snag a table. I got the crab and pork dumplings and a bbq pork bun. The order was made quickly and everything was fresh and hot. The soup dumpling was nice with thin skin and meaty inside. I couldn't really taste the crab, so I'll prob stick to pork ones next time. The pork bun was my favorite. The bread was soft and fluffy and the filling was so good. It's not red like the traditional ones that I've had, but I would go back for these buns again!!

{"Review Text":"I love dumplings. I have flagged coming to Juicy Dumpling for a while. I have come close to getting food from this eatery a couple of times within the last year, except that I ended up doing dim sum across the street. I didn't feel like it afterwards. However, I was in Chinatown in July for ice cream and bubble tea, so I was ready to grab takeout here. Juicy Dumpling is on Fantuan. I ordered these items through the app: - Steamed mini soup dumplings (6) - Pan-fried chicken dumplings (4) - Shrimp wonton (8) in a spicy sauce I got word that it would take twenty minutes to prepare. It was enough time for me to wrap up shopping at Chinatown Centre and walk up the street. Juicy Dumpling is part of Dragon Centre. I hadn't been here in eons. The eatery has a separate street entrance off Dundas Street West. You can also cut through the eatery to get to the mall. I got a man at the counter. I said that I had a Fantuan order and rattled off the last three digits of my order. He couldn't find my order. It was a bit troublesome. I showed him the order number off my app. He still couldn't find it. He had to ask his female colleague who immediately found my order packed in a paper bag with handles. Weird. It was the only downside to this experience. I thanked both folks and headed out the door, and around the corner to my car. There is seating at this eatery. I'd say that it was 60% full when I was there at around 7:. Seating is limited, so there's always the food court if there isn't any free seating. I had thought about eating my food at home. However, it smelled so good next to me in the car that I ate everything immediately. I had enough paid parking time to indulge. The pan-fried chicken dumplings were excellent. The wrapper on each one was crispy at the bottom and delicious all around. The chicken filling was generous and seasoned nicely. The dumplings were a bit oiler than I had expected. They glistened, to the point where I thought that they were dumpling bodybuilders. However, they didn't taste greasy. I had the soup dumplings next. They were delicate. Each one had delicious soup in them. I wish that they had more soup. Perhaps it was such a hot day that a lot of it had evaporated by the time I got to my car. The broth was divine and the pork filling was excellent. I then indulged in the shrimp wontons in a spicy sauce. It was my least favourite because it needed more flavour. The shrimp were fresh, but weren't seasoned. This dish needed more green onions and flavouring to make it special. The spicy sauce was hot and didn't have any flavour to help out the natural shrimp flavour of the wontons. Green onions would have helped. I'd be happy if there were peanuts or some garnish. It was unseasoned shrimp in a spicy sauce. Boring. I'd return for more dumplings. I'd pass on the hot shrimp wontons. Stick to the pork and chicken fillings instead. (340)","Sentiment":"positive"}

Don't be distracted by anything else, just get the soup dumplings (both steamed and pan-fried) and the pan fried juicy buns. Nothing else deserves more attention than these menu items.

The beef meatballs were just okay.  The sesame balls were very good.

{"Review Text":"I love Saigon Lotus but I do feel some of the dishes are hit or miss. This review is for two separate occasions only a week apart! First meal I had the BBQ noodle soup with vegan egg noodle. The small ($13) portion was enough and super filling for me. Came with lots of vegan meats, fried mushroom balls, and veggies with their vegan egg noodles (wonder how they make these vegan!). It was good but the other times I had it before, it was better and more flavourful. Still enjoyed it. Second time, I wanted to try something from their chef's special menu. I got the pad thai with BBQ vegan meat ($15) and wow. I LOVED IT. Came with deliciously pan fried rice noodles in a tomato sauce and tamarind. Right when I got it, I mixed it with the cabbage, peanuts, and coriander and it wilted the cabbage into deliciousness. This dish was so good and I think I found my favourite dish from Saigon Lotus. Service is consistently great. Really wholesome restaurant that I'll continue to support.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I got the vegan combo #, miso tofu, caramel seitan stir-fry cabbage, carrot and other veggies served with a decent plate of HOT rice (heart eyes), and a small soup which tasted like pho broth. The meal was pretty filling and I particularly enjoyed the soup and the sweet and sour crispy tofu the most. The rice was hot which I appreciated especially because some places serve rice warm and sometimes even cold. What I love about Saigon Lotus is that it omits animal products without being in-your-face about it. The food still tastes good, and sometimes their seitan is made to mimic the taste\/texture of meat. I will be back next time to try more of their rice dishes and their Vietnamese iced coffee!","Sentiment":"positive"}

I had their egg noodles with soup before and they are a much better deal. Especially because they add more of the seitan and the vegan fish cakes which taste exactly like fish cakes.

{"Review Text":"Solid from beginning to end with great customer service. I am not a vegan, but for those who enjoy this type of food, I must admit this restaurant was offering dishes from appetizers to dessert that were delicious. I am a raging carnivore, and I always feel like I haven't eaten when I've had dishes that were vegan or had some sort of alternative meat. In this case, I was incredibly surprised at how full of flavour and texture these dishes were. I didn't miss anything from the substitutes they used for meat. The dishes that I knew in its original format with either chicken or beef, were delicious. I had pad Thai and vermicelli as well, and as you can see from the photos, a large variety of options, not a single one didn't deliver on flavor. I think Vietnamese food is a great vehicle for this type of dining. I never would've thought to say this, but I would definitely eat here again. I was so happy! I was floored at how delicious every single dish I had was. for someone like me that always feels that I'm missing something when I eat a vegan or vegetarian meal this was an eye-opener! I would definitely return!!!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"A friend and I came by here for a quick bite and overall, both of us left this place feeling a little less than satisfied with our meal. Having tried Vietnamese vegan & vegetarian food before in the States, I found that Saigon Lotus fell just a little short in terms of the flavors and consistency. Unsure on what to order, we opted to get the vegan combo #. Thoughts on the food: -Soup: A bit bland and not very memorable -Tofu: Texture was a bit hard to chew and was a bit too sweet -Chicken\/Plant Base dish 1: Forgot the name but it had a nice savory and sweet flavor to it -Chicken\/Plant Base dish 2: Forgot the name but overall, not my favorite since the taste was a bit off (sour and a bit salty) -Sides: Rice, kimchi - which was pretty decent in comparison to regular kimchi -Portion Size: If you're not too hungry and want more of a sampler style, you can try out the combo options that gives you a little sides.

You could also get vegan egg noodles or rice noodles. The broth was amazing. My family isn't vegan and they were raving about how good the food was.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I got a couple of tacos here: the pollo al pastor and the pescado. I had heard before coming here that the pescado is a must-try, but it was shadowed in flavor by the pollo al pastor in my opinion. The pollo al pastor was much more interesting. It has a spicy kick to it, so not recommended for those who cant eat spicy.","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Honestly one of the best taco spots in the city! We were blown away with how flavourful each and every taco we had was. Our top favourites were the chorizo con papa and the carne con queso. One order is a single taco so it is slightly on the more expensive side but it is so justified and worth it! The portion size is hefty for a single taco, but at the same time the ingredients are not spilling over the sides. You can taste the individual layers of the ingredients in the tacos which was amazing and all the flavours combined together was truly divine. Slightly disappointed that some items we wanted to try were sold out but by no means did that take away from the experience! The service here was good - they were quick to get back to us and we got sit down relatively quick. Definitely a must try spot if you love tacos!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Long story short: Delicious and fresh tacos in a warm welcoming atmosphere! Long story long: Great place to go for tacos! There is limited seating, often in tables of 2, so I can see it filling up very quickly. It may be more difficult to get in without reservations. The decor is vibrant and eclectic. Our waiter was kind, attentive and helpful when we had questions. We tried the guacamole and salsa to start, followed by the pascado and tinga de pollo tacos. Fair warning that it is a bit on the expensive side and it is only . They are fresh, a big more stuffed and well made, so I think it's worth it! The pascado taco was delicious and less spicy. On one hand, it's great that the menu is small, so it's easier to choose and stick to it, but I was hoping there were more options that were not as spicy (my tolerance is shamefully low). Each taco had a bit of a kick. The tinga de pollo was great too, with plenty for , just a bit too much on the spicy side for me! Seeing me struggle, the waitress offered to get me a different one, which was lovely hospitality, but I declined because I'm not a coward. That dessert menu was tempting. We didn't indulge in it this time, but it's on my list for next time. I recommend a visit!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Campechano... oh boy! We got there with no reservation and super excited since hearing about their mention on the Bib Gourmand Michelin Star guide. We got seated very quickly and with no problem. Patio vibes were nice, but nothing overly impressive. Our server came with menus after a little while and had to take us through there lack of menu options. So for starters there were no appetizers, because they had no tortilla chips (excuse me?! Is this a Mexican restaurant) so right off the bat it gave me a weird feeling. Then they went on explaining they didn't have a few of the tacos on the menu and ended up the conversation by saying there is only . I was super disappointed in this. Greg ended up ordering a Negra Modelo and I got a White wine by the glass. My white wine was served on the same glass wear as the water, mildly chilled and just not even 5oz of wine in that glass for $9?! For food Greg went with the Tocihongos (bacon and mushrooms) and Chorizo con Papas. And I went for the Pescado and I thought I tried their Campechano (it has the name of the restaurant, so must be good right?!) No surprise here, we were so disappointed with all of our options. Tocihongos was a fine taco, a little too greasy. The Pescado was just a simple very plain fish taco. The Campechano let's me just say was oil and chunks of what seemed like ground beef with way to much sauce on it. For all the tacos the tortillas felt steamed?! Not pan fried as a taco usually is, which made the tacos that much harder to eat. Overall super disappointed, I don't think this place is worth the hype (sorry Michelin Guide... This is the first time you've disappointed me) and to be fully transparent each of those tacos were $10, not worth the price either.","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"A main establishment in the culinary diverse area that is the Kensington market. Otto's brings a germain flair to the area by offering currywursts and doners. I've been to this place a couple times and they have been consistent with their boxes. Would definitely recommend for tourist and locals! Halloumi box - Although not a doner, halloumi is a middle eastern cheese I've fallen in love with recently.  It has a chewy tough bouncy texture and very salty flavour. This is contrasted with the crispiness and fluffiness of the fries. In terms of flavour you have the saltiness from the cheese and a mix of mayo and hot sauce. A small box was sufficient for me as the fried ingredients made it super heavy. My friend had the lamb box. Lamb was tasty (maybe too salty as you want the lamb flavour to come out as well). At the end there was a lot of oil remaining in the bottom of the lamb box, so it would be even more heavy. Passionfruit lychee slushie - Worked really well as a summer drink and counteracted the heaviness from the fries and cheese. The ice in the slushie is very interesting as its not very fine, instead it was rather chunky and round making it feel like a peculiar texture. The big chunks also meant that as you drink from the straw, you get more of the juice than the ice, so I'd recommend consuming with a fork. This establishment is on the pricey side and on the heavy side, so its less of a regular affair. For me, it is a once in a while kinda thing, but I would highly recommend!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Even worst than I remember! I came here about five years ago and despite the high rating but I was not impressed. But today I figured I wanted something new so I would tried agian. And it was a lot more worst. I ordered and I was surprised that it was ready within a few min. But I found out why. It way too salty and the chicken was not fresh. Like some restaurants who hire lazy employees they would cut the chicken the chicken from the spit and leave it there till a new order then reheat it. When I ate it it was barely warm and the fries were also not fresh. Maybe from another order? There is not enough veggies or sauce to have different flavour. This is really bad. Think they just stopped proper training and proper quality control. Just disgusting. Don't even waste your time and money. Worst meal I had in months or this year and I eat out often.","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"\/\/. What else would you need from a restaurant? It's a Doner restaurant with a ode to German cuisine. Like most kebab restaurants it caters mostly for take-outs and deliveries. However, they have some tables available to consume there - it is a small establishment. Their menu has Doner, Teller or bratwurst for main entr\u00e9e - depending on your liking. I got the small Lamb teller on salad with yogurt and hot sauce to mimic the kebab trucks in NYC. I highly recommend the small serving as it filled me up for the rest of the day of walking. The meat was greatly seasoned, the yogurt balanced out the hot sauce. As you can see from the picture posted, the size of the box is small but it's packed with food. The salad was fresh and helped fulfill the whole dish. I recommend this choice. It took approximately 5--away. They give you paper napkin and fork. This is a great choice for a quick lunch if you're about to walk and explore the city.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I've been here a few times and this is the first time I opted for the vegan\/vegetarian version. I got the gemuse box, which is eggplant and veggies and my partner got the haloumi doner. It looks just as good as it tastes. However, I did find my gemuse box (eggplant and veggies) left me a bit peckish afterwards. My box was mixed with fries. The doner may be a better option because it comes with the breading that may keep you fuller. I'm not vegetarian, but I think some vegan\/vegetarian-friendly protein doner style options would be great to make the meal more filling. I had no issues with it being filling when I order the meat versions in the past.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The beef d\u00f6ner is my personal favourite - it's so flavourful and juicy, and the yogurt sauce really ties everything together. The lamb d\u00f6ner is also very good, and the chicken d\u00f6ner is a great option if you're looking for something a bit lighter.

{"Review Text":"This was a good experience, but not amazing - more like a 3.5. We hadn't been to a restaurant for Chinese food for so long and our cravings were high. We'd read all the great things about the spicy cumin lamb skewers here and couldn't wait to try them. I was hankering for my favorite dish, Szhechuan  boiled fish with peppercorns. We ordered those, plus the spicy shredded potato and the spicy green beans. It was kind of shocking when everything arrived about 'd ordered. Even so, nothing was sizzling or steaming - but everything was sufficiently hot (except the potatoes, which are served cold). The beans were stellar and a generous portion. We found the lamb skewers good, but a little chewy and, honestly, a little too lean? I prefer having a little fat on my skewers for that crispy deliciousness. My big disappointment was the peppercorn fish. It just didn't have the spice level I'm used too - not enough peppercorns, perhaps, maybe also lacking some chili oil? It just tasted mildly spicy despite the dish being full of red chilis... the fish was a little lacklustre as well - didn't have that slighly crispy, salty peppery edge to it. We ate it all and had a satisfying meal... it just left me comparing to other places where I've had slightly better versions of the fish dish and skewers...  and for a little less. It was a pretty expensive meal in all for , no drinks - around $85.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Our food was sitting on another table for a while and they simply said \"oops, sorry! I'm sure they haven't touched your food\" It's covid era- I have no interest in eating food that's on stranger's tables. 2. Unprofessional, extremely unprofessional. We informed them the wrong skewers were delivered to us, the first response was \"who took your order?\" Followed by - \"it's not my fault you got the wrong food, I didn't put this on your table\". We didn't even know how to respond, just take it away. There isn't any need to stand there and tell me the failings of your coworkers. 3. Disgusting food - we ordered a beef wrap and the beef was ice cold and wrap luke warm. They couldn't even manage to reheat a frozen product. 4. Not even close to authentic. They charge for BBQ skewers but the meat was boiled and the sauce tasted like it was from a bottle. Do they think cumin is too expensive to use? 5. Nice interiors but very dirty with sticky tables and unwashed chopsticks.","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Halal. No pork served here. Huge variety in dishes.  Menu with a lot of pictures of the dishes so you know what you're getting. The food was generally good. The customer service was TERRIBLE. They gave us one menu even though there was two of us. They never came by our table to see if we needed anything although they constantly passed by.  We always had to flag them down. Typically they provide the green tea but no one provided any and we had ask for it. When our tea was room temperature, they just poured hot water in it which diluted it and made it lose its flavour. we asked one of the staff they had a little sweet and sour sauce, they said no but when we asked another person, they provided some. For some reason even though they weren't closing for another 3., at the end of our meal they just proactively brought the machine for us to pay, even though we wanted to stay a little longer and order dessert, so forget it... we just left and got dessert somewhere else! For the Lotus salad was pretty cool. But the pulled noodles dish was very chewy. I would not recommend it at all. The veggie dumplings tasted like boiled seaweed. And the beef pancake was a little bit cold and flavorless. Green P street parking is avail outside. I personally think I may not return.

I wanted to try BURRATA PICCANTE but it was sold out in front of me!!! :( So, we got : # BUFALOTTA # COTTO E FUNGHI The Bufalotta had fresh cheese, tomato and basil. The ingredients were generously arranged on the baked pizza dough. The Cotto e Funghi was very flavorful. It used good quality Mozzarella and Prosciutto Cotto Reggiano, and extra virgin olive oil with generous amount of delicately aromatic mushrooms and basil leaves. However - I was disappointed by their crust. They were too hard to chew.  The crust is the most important part as it holds all these quality ingredients. Unfortunate... When we were in the line for our order, I saw a few eat-in customers who returned their pizzas for better crust. The store was willing to take their pizzas back to offer new ones. If we were eat-in customers, we could have done the same for better crust texture.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Browsing around Eataly is always a positive experience - the way the 2nd floor is laid out is like an Ikea for Italian food & equipment. I want to buy everything. Everything looks well prepared and made and worth its price. In their produce section, they also have pantry and fridge items focusing on local businesses, which I loved seeing. During this visit, I purchased a Fragola (Strawberry) Sorbetto in a small sugar cone, ~$7ish. The sorbet was smooth, creamy, and sweet, slowly melting with every bite taken. I wish it were a little less sweet, but understandable that it may be required to keep that texture and consistency. Also got a slice of funghi pizza for ~$11. It was covered in slices of mushrooms and cheese. I felt the dough could've been more easy to chew through. The slice was big, but not sure if it was worth its price... It was very busy during my visit ~6PM (Sunday), so all staff were preoccupied in maintaining store standards or serving guests. Thankfully didn't need assistance so that didn't matter much for me.

They have such a wide range of cheese, cured meats, and fresh pastas - it's an endless debate of which ones to get! Of course with all specialty stores, it comes at a price so I would say that most items here are fairly expensive. I've ordered a slice of margherita and a slice of mushroom pizza from their pizza counter before and felt that the pizza was too hard. The crust was cutting my mouth and a bit too dry. Not my preference. The pistachio gelato from the gelato stand on the other hand, was delicious! Amazing rich flavour with no artificial colouring.

Unfortunately, I didn't find it really outstanding, the meat was a bit tough to chew at times. This was a decent meal but wasn't really worth the hype to wait in long lines for. The place is a bit on the medium size so ideally come for small groups. The service was really friendly and attentive.

Luckily the second time I went I was seat immediately and I was able to enjoy a nice dinner. The interior is nice, it is all wood with small decorative pieces on the wall. I ordered the classic combo which came with the Katsugyu on top of a bed of rice, miso soup, some vegetables and an egg side dish. Overall, the food is pretty good. I honestly was expecting a little more. The meat wasn't super juicy and a little tough but it filled my steak craving. It's definitely somewhere I would try out at least once. I went for dinner, but I heard some of the lunch combos are also good and perhaps better priced.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We tried the Australian Wagyu Short Rib Zen. The gyukatsu was smaller than what we expected from looking at the menu image - the meat-plate ratio was off. Wagyu katsu, turned out that it's not really my thing but was nice to try. Spinach tasted good. My friend also had shrimp sando and she liked it. Service was very good. The staff confused about sweeten vs. unsweetened tea but acknowledged the mistake immediately and offered a new beverage. Cozy ambience, has many booth inside.

All dinner sets came with miso soup, hot spring egg, and Japanese rice. Good portions, good taste. It was just too busy at night time and made you feel you were in a rush. The waitresses were nice enough and didn't hurry us as we got a group of . But there were just a lot of people swamped at the door to intensify my nerves.

{"Review Text":"I had previously walked past this restaurant so many times and finally went in for dinner today. I am so glad I did. As you walk in, you see photos of all the people of note who have visited for a meal along the wall and it's a very impressive! We were seated quickly and it wasn't busy being a Sunday night, but there were several tables still eating. We were served quickly and the owner even stopped by to make sure we were ordering the right amount of food and being taken care of. Our entrees and banchan arrived quickly and hot so we were eager to dig in.  We had the soondubu and ddukbokki (I added the bulgogi and it was so delicious). The portions are hearty and the food has great flavour. You can tell everything is made with fresh, quality ingredients. We'll definitely be back to try more, as all the dishes we saw coming out of the kitchen looked delicious. The highlight was most definitely the service. The owner, Jason, takes the time to get to know you, ensures you're enjoying your meal, and shares his love for his mom's cooking and keeping her spirit in everything they do. It was a really incredible dining experience and I'm already looking forward to coming back.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"My boyfriend and I were walking in Koreatown on Saturday evening and decided to have dinner around there. We picked this restaurant as we saw a lot of people inside. As soon as we entered, there was a welcome sign to greet customers and a board to write your name and number of people. The staff referred to the board to call customers as the tables opened up. The decor reflected the name of the restaurant- it looked like going back in time to an old neighbohood. The place was packed and the crowd was forming inside and outside. We waited about , then our name was called by the staff. Our waiter was a young man who greeted us and brought water, utensils and side dishes. My boyfriend was so excited since this was his first time trying Korean food! It took a bit of time for us to decide as there was a lot on the menu. After, my boyfriend chose large size Kampungki (deep-fried chicken in sweet and spicy sauce) and ordered a small bowl of rice on the side. I picked Soondubu (soft tofu stew with assorted seafood and mixed vegetables with rice on the side). We enjoyed our meal- my boyfriend said the chicken pieces were yummy- the chicken pieces were crispy and sweet and spicy on the outside and juicy inside. The Soondubu was also good, I liked the spice level and there was good amount of seafood and vegetables with soft tofu). Our server was helpful and friendly, he brought us everything that we asked for (e.g. fork, extra napkins, more water, hot sauce). We had a fun time here for dinner. The menu has a variety of items, so you can't go wrong here! There's something for everyone!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Went here today for the very first time. I cannot believe this place has been under my nose for the past . Loved everything about this place! Service was prompt to seat us and take our order. It was a little laxidazial toward the end, we waited a long while before getting our final check and my friend was attempting to flag the waitress down on several occassions and to no avail. I started with a warm , likely, green tea, it tasted like it had been made with toasted rice. Delicious and very soothing to my stomach. The rice cakes were very unlike, the hard, round store bought ones. These ones come rolled up (cylinder in shape), soft, fresh, warm, in a spicy sauce with some interesting fish cake- I tried this and did not enjoy it and a boiled egg. The texture of the rice cake resembles a really thick and big noodle. Except its not as heavy as white flour, its lighter, chewy, interesting and tasty. They brought us complimentary miso soup. I love, love, love, love miso soup. It is always a great starter. For my main, I ordered the stone bowl with spicy shrimp. Absolutely scrumptous. It came out sizzling, gotta love that sound. So many mini shrimps, adequately dispersed. It came with a runny yoke, fried egg on the top with strips of seasweed, sesame seeds, some bean sprouts, and green and red pepper. Extra bean sprouts, kimchi and more fish cake strips were offered on the side, as additional toppings. The best part about the bowl, is the well cooked rice at the very bottom. So incredibly tasty. I would have preferred my fried egg, well done, with a cooked centre. I do not enjoy runny yoke (The oozing of it does not appeal), yet allowed it to seep into my rice and ate it nonetheless. I liked that we were there for a good couple hours, taking our time with our meals and there was no rush. Its easy to continue to pick away at your food when conversation is flowing and time is passing. My friend also enjoyed her dish, the same, a stone bowl, except instead of shrimp, she had pork. Loved the spaciousness. Seriously, so much room! The booths are substantial. You could even get a lil' private room, their tables are wide- there is enough room for everything, their hallways are wide, their stairs to go down to the rest rooms, wide. So much space... I love it. Newer places these days have such condensed seating, barely enough room between your table and the guests next to you. Much less, on your own table for your own apps, mains and drinks. Its unbarebly uncomfortable. Not to mention the loudness it gets in smaller spaces. Sound and noise tend to bounce off the walls, contrary to how many people are seated. Here though, at Korea Village, peace can be sought. Although today, the person next to us was talking so loudly it felt like I had to talk over him just to converse with my friend. It was a tad annoying and I was thankful when they left. They may have felt the same about me. We still managed though. They have pictures of famous people who have been there, side by side with the owner, among them, Nelly Furtado, Jackie Chan and Sandra Oh, so cool they commemorate in that way. And they won in 2021, as NOW magazine's readers' choice for Korean Food. Definitely worth returning.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"BlueBlood Steakhouse at Casa Loma is an absolute gem that left me thoroughly impressed. From the moment I stepped through the grand entrance of Casa Loma, the historic ambiance set the stage for an unforgettable dining experience. The highlight of my evening was undoubtedly the Rib Eye, a succulent 18oz masterpiece sourced from Guelph, Ontario. Cooked to perfection, each bite was a symphony of flavor and tenderness. The service was exceptional, with the staff embodying professionalism and attentiveness without being intrusive.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"The experience of dining here plays a huge factor in my rating. It's a castle, so everything looks and feels like royalty. You're treated like a special guest from the moment you walk in. We had reserved an outdoor pod for some privacy and it's nice, as you're able to enjoy the weather while still being a little more tucked away. For appetizers, we had the steak tartare in bone marrow canoe and it was an interesting dish. It did look pretty cool and I've never had something like it. It tasted pretty good but I probably wouldn't order it again. I also had a caesar salad; I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to get it because their menu says minimum of two people and my boyfriend can't eat caesar salads, but that is just for the tableside caesar. I was surprised by how much I could taste the anchovy flavour in the salad. It tasted fresh, and was a nice twist to your classic caesar salad. I was already getting full at this point so I opted to just order the lobster mac as my main and my boyfriend had the 12oz strip loin. The lobster mac, I had high hopes for - I LOVE mac and cheese so I thought this was sure to be a hit. But it was such a huge let down. It tasted so fishy, the sauce was watery and not cheesy at all, and the taste was just bad. My boyfriend enjoyed his steak, though, so I guess there's that. We had written that it was our anniversary so they kindly gave us two champagne glasses on the house. Our server was really lovely; he gave us a little tour of the castle (the parts that he was allowed to show us) after our meal and gave us some fun history facts. We got to take a look at the garden (there was a separate event happening so couldn't actually walk in) and of course, the iconic view from the terrace. Overall, it's definitely worth a visit for the views and getting to visit the castle. But I wasn't wow'ed by the food.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I enjoyed this restaurant inside Casa Loma. I didn't know what to expect but with the name blue blood, I expected to pay a hefty dinner fee. However, I found that there were affordable options for drinks and food on the menu and also higher priced items. Came here after soul in the city, where the food options was limited. You get to enjoy your meal in a magnificently opulent setting, with high ceilings, chandeliers, tufted couches dark wooden walls, plastered ceiling and of course a meal inside the famous casa loma. You can sit by the balcony where there's window doors, they also have clear domes to sit in outside. Washroom is inside casa Loma, so you get to enjoy the main hall of casa Loma too. I was seated by the balcony windows so I can actually hear the soul in the city from the restaurant and walk out the balcony to view the gardens. Staff is very attentive. Parking is $15, valet is $20. I am in love the complimentary cheese bread. It's so tasty. They did bring water which was not ordered but charged for approximately $8.. I didn't even drink it ,I didn't know, so I didn't like that part. They give a cute little chocolate in the end.  They added the 20% gratuity already on the bill. I ordered the Canadian ribeye medium for $85. It was great. I could eat the whole thing as the fat was perfectly caramelized. It was delicious. Great seasoning. It came on a skillet, but I think that was for show because my steak was definitely not sizzling and I didn't feel the cast iron skillet was particularly hot.  Shots are about $ $9. Of course all amounts are subject to hst. I would definitely visit again. It's a great vibe.","Sentiment":"positive"}

We told them we were going to leave but then they suddenly made an exception for our table. Service is extremely slow. We probably waited around 20-. There were only two other tables besides ours. All food took long to arrive. Bills took even longer to arrive. We were there for 3+ hours, most of it was waiting time. Food was good but not amazing. I didn't have a steak which I know is their specialty, but I had the wagyu burger. Very large in size, very average in taste. The fries are huge but almost tasteless. Being in Casa Loma, the ambiance and environment is beautiful. Presentation of food and drinks were on point. However I would only recommend going here if you want to splurge on $80+ steaks, $25+ cocktails and $20+ desserts.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Atmosphere : super friendly staff, very knowledgeable and chatty (our waiter was funny, professional, and attentive) . Venue is one of a kind - restaurant itself is classy and gives an old library \/ castle feel - you are free to tour the castle's first floor after dinner or as you're waiting for food, as well as the gardens. Makes for some lovely photo opportunities during sunset! We dressed up (and so did many other patrons) so a nice place for a celebration or just a fancy dinner :) Food: 1) Gravlax: was good, loved the fresh dill in this dish to balance out the smoked salmon. It is quite smokey however so wouldn't recommend if that isn't your thing 2) Wagyu Carpaccio: amazing. Loved the bite of the mustard seeds. 3) Porterhouse: probably one of the best cooked steaks I've had - Nicely cooked to medium with a good (but NOT burnt) crust. Super juicy, melts in your mouth, amazing flavors.Was able to share with 1-. 4) Chilean seabass: love the tenderness and fattiness of the fish. Buttery and yummy :) 5) Creamed Corn: was good, added a nice sweetness to all the savory dishes. One of my all time favorite sides 6) Gorgonzola Gnocchi: my least favorite dish here, probably because I don't LOVE cheese and gorgonzola was a bit strong for me, but gnocchi was good quality and if you love cheesy dishes - this one's for you!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"BlueBlood easily goes on my top favourites list. Their negroni is fantastic & the grilled octopus was quite good but the mains are what stole the show. The strip loin was cooked a perfect med rare, just the way I like, & the chimichurri sauce that came on the side was some of the best I've ever had. I also loved that I was given , very nice touch & I love having options. The lamb is also insanelyyy delicious. No words to fully describe it. Got the saut\u00e9ed broccolini on the side & it was wonderfully cooked - still crunchy, but still tender. The ambiance is warm, romantic & very cozy. The cowhide touches on the booths & the huge moose head over the bar were very unique touches. Not to mention the service was fantastic - the bartender would come around to refold your napkin when you went to the bathroom, happily made recommendations based on personal taste & allergies, etc. BlueBlood is the place to be for a romantic date night, intimate family dinner, or any other special occasion. Highly recommend.","Sentiment":"positive"}

It's not a real Gyubee experience without the long wait time for dinner! Note they only accept cash or debit card here. When we finally got our table for dinner, we ordered many plates of beef, pork belly, and lamb, but the one that stood out was the prime kalbi. So fatty but flavourful! Grilled some of the king oyster mushroom, and it tasted almost like meat. We also tried the salmon which came in a tin foil container with a number on top to let you know how many minutes to let it cook on the grill. The only thing I wish is the server would let us know which each of the meats were when they were brought to the table. As for the bibimbap and cold noodles, these were tasty sides to go with the bbq meat. The dessert options are limited to only cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Melona (one popsicle per person which is either strawberry or mango flavour). Service was efficient, helping take away empty plates throughout our meal, changing our grill without us having to ask, and ready for us whenever we wanted to top up our order.

I was amazed that we ordered butternut squash and crab ravioli that was off menu items( they used to have on the menu), without hesitation they would make them for us. Ravioli dough was for sure made from scratch, that means they probably added stuffing and cooked to order. How special is that they would do that when restaurant was a full house? And my ravioli was delish! Whatever they did with the sauce was like thick gravy and I wiped my plate with extra bread. I was also amazed by how generous portion size was. I was stuffed after my ravioli & friend's salmon dish was like 1.. And the price was very resonable. Highly recommend this place.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"On a street off of yonge, lies this place amongst a few other quite nice restaurants. I came with great company, and we enjoyed our meal and experience. The ambience was nice, you can tell the restaurant has been there for a long time, and even though the tables were quite close together, it was not loud. The service was very accommodating, letting us take our time with ordering and coming around refilling our water quite often. In addition, the food came out at an appropriate speed -- not too soon, but we did not wait long either. The menu itself did not have an overly extensive as usual the case for other restaurants, which I quite liked as a large menu tends to overwhelm me. We ordered two starters: the grilled calamari and antipasti for two. They were good, but I would say they were overpriced for their portions. For mains, I went with the fettuccine with smoked salmon in a ros\u00e9 sauce. You may be like \"Smoked salmon in pasta?!\" and I understand, I actually only initially ordered it because I LOVE ros\u00e9. But, it was a very delicious dish! The taste of the smoked salmon was very light and paired quite nicely with the ros\u00e9 sauce. The fettuccine was cooked perfectly too in my opinion. A pleasant surprise. The other dishes ordered were the Gnocchi and a Seafood Risotto. *note that the smoked salmon fettuccine and risotto were specials, so they were not on the menu* For dessert I ordered the red velvet cake. I won't lie, I was caught off guard at first by the lack of volume for the cake, but the flavour made up for it. My favourite thing about red velvet cakes is that if done well, they are not too sweet or artificial tasting. This one checked off all the boxes! The cream cheese frosting was soooo good. It didn't stick to the top of my mouth or need a sip of water to wash it down. It complimented the red velvet part perfectly. If you like Italian food, I'd totally give this place a try! The portions are also quite generous. I wouldn't recommend coming here in a large group though (no more than 4-6) as the interior is not super spacey. Maybe a good place for a date! 9\/10.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I'm not sure why the caesar salad was $2-'t think it had any bacon bits or cheese on it. My wife had a fried chicken burger but it was way overcooked - and this is coming from her taste where she often orders chicken well-done.

We started off with nachos. We shared it between two people, but I think it could be shared between 4. We added chili and it had a kick of spice to it which I loved and it wasn't very runny, more meaty. The cheese was melted throughout the platter which was good, almost every 3rd chip had some cheese. It also came with a side of guacamole which was nice. The nacho chips were very oily and noticeably salty though. Although the toppings were good, I wasn't a fan of the chips. We also shared a regular burger. It was steaming hot when it came out and more massive than we exected- with two patties instead of one! It was tasty, but like the nachos, the main part of the burger - patty - was too salty for me. Overall, I wouldn't say their food was the best I've ever had, but it satisfied our nacho and burger craving. The saltiness was too overpowering for us - personally, I felt like I drank as much water at the gym working out as I did while eating here.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Best. Burgers. Ever. Two 4oz beef patties, with fries, for $16. They have about 5-'t go wrong with any of them. Beer selections are plentiful too. This is officially my favourite go-to place for a juiiiicy burger","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Sooooo it's summer, perfect time for fresh beer and evenings out with good friends! Came here with a good Yelpie friend, we had a great Monday evening. I ordered the \"Beat the Heat\" wheat beer and I absolutely loved it, it was incredibly fresh and with an orangy \/ citrus note that made the beer very tasty without being too sweet. The service was awesome, very welcoming, I asked some questions about their craft beers and asked for recommendations and they took their time to walk me through the menu while giving some good tips! Burger was not the best I ever had but it was OK and it included two patties, which made the meal satisfying and very filling - and the blue cheese sauce was spot-on, not too light not too heavy, but creamy at the same time. They do a pub trivia every Monday evening, in case you wanna enjoy your beer while you have fun answering general trivia questions.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"A place called \"Tallboys\" is going to have a decent selection of beer. That's pretty much a given. However, what the name of the place doesn't tell you is how damn good their burgers are. You're going to get some THICC, freshly-ground patties on warm buttery buns that will knock your socks off. Tallboys is the perfect place for a burger and a pint on a warm summer day. Don't get me wrong - these burgers aren't on the cheap side, but I assure you that they're worth every penny. Everything else about Tallboys is either average or better in my opinion. Great wait staff, casual atmosphere, and just a good, friendly vibe overall. I'd recommend checking out Tallboys next time you're in the Bloor-Ossington area.","Sentiment":"positive"}

We were graciously served by Chad, who did a phenomenal job making us feel welcomed and appreciated. His recommendations and pairings were outstanding, and I cannot thank him enough for creating a fantastic atmosphere. I started with the Jambon & Fromage, a very interesting and flavourful combination, especially with the walnut butter, a nice little starter. The main course was the Boeuf, which I recommend. Tender, flavourful, beautifully presented. The accompaniments were well thought out, and the potato terrine (pave) was delicious. For dessert we had the lemon buttermilk cake with blueberries and buttermilk ice cream. Members of our party had other options which they also enjoyed immensely. Overall the food was well presented, well explained and downright delicious. Thank you for the fantastic evening, and we will certainly be coming back!","Sentiment":"positive"}

The restaurant achieves the holy trinity for me which is unparalleled service, elevated cuisine and a charming atmosphere. Generally, patrons come here for a special occasion. While dining, there were several birthdays and a wedding dinner taking place. Everything was sublime, from the lavish cocktails, to the artfully presented dessert. The coquilles st Jacques was decadent, the chicken special was indeed a special experience (in the best way possible), the dessert was another highlight of the experience. Come here for a memorable time.","Sentiment":"positive"}

For our entrees, I had the pork loin while my fiancee had the veal.  I loved the cook of the pork slices and the purees and sauces that came with the dish were excellent.

While the restaurant is beautiful and spacious, they seem to have a habit of not respecting reservations, in one case making me wait . And no, it wasn't overly busy. The food itself is hit and miss, but mostly miss. Having tried several main dishes, they all fall flat with weird textures and\/or flavours.

{"Review Text":"This is the 2nd Planta location I've been to. This location has a focus on Asian fusion. There was not much parking available. I took a Lyft so didn't have to worry about that. I didn't have any waiting time and was sat immediately. I ordered the Plant Power lunch special. This is a really great deal, only $, appetizer, and a cookie. I went with the broccoli & truffle fried rice. The broccoli was banging and almost made me moan out loud. Literally the best broccoli ever made. The truffle rice was nice and savory, just what I expected from fried rice. It did have seaweed added which was a surprise (probably didn't read the menu close enough) I ordered a matcha latte which was nice, although tasted a bit too mild\/milky. The cookie I took to go (too full from the food) and it was a solid 10\/10. The only bad part about the experience was the waiting once at the table. My server Melanie was super pleasant but you could tell they didn't have enough waiters on staff. I was watching her run around for \/my check. It would've been nice to see a manager making the rounds to help out & do table touches. Overall enjoyed it, but would probably sit at the bar if dining solo as I started feeling way too antsy and just wanted to go.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"It's an Asian-fusion vegan place, has an oriental-style decoration. Good ambience. The Peking Jackfruit Salad I had was good - green papaya slaw was the crispy part, jackfruit was the soft part and it tasted like chicken. The salad was topped with peanuts, herbs and lemongrass. The server said it was small but I couldn't finish. My friend had the Udon Noodles, which looked creamy and she validated the same. The Avocado Lime Tartare was great, but we had an incident - there was a long piece of hair in the tartare... Anyways they got us a new plate. I liked the combination of avocado and beetroot, the taro chips were yummy. The Greenie in a Bottle was kinda overpriced - a small glass of kale and ingredients for $9. Service was good. The staff double-checked if I paid for tips... I paid 20% for me and my friend, guess it's no longer enough for them in the inflation era.

When I got to the one on Queen West, I was surprised by how nice the restaurant looked  with its bold dark interior. I ordered a starter called Peking Jackfruits.  The name sounded very exotic, which intrigued me.   Plus I also like jackfruit.  But the way it was prepared in this dish wasn't to my taste as they cooked it.  I think I will stay with the fresh, uncooked version. However, what I couldn't get enough of was the truffle mushroom udon.  It was heavenly.  The noodle was soft and so slurpable. The soup was flavourful and dreamy creamy.  I would have happily dipped the bread in the left over soup if I had some.  I'd go back for more!!","Sentiment":"positive"}

The restaurant's atmosphere is pleasant, and the staff are friendly and attentive. However, the prices at Raku are a bit higher than expected for udon noodles.

Had the small filet with mashed and some garlic bread to start.  The old Hy's had spectacular garlic bread - crispy and flavourful.  This was really greasy and salty without that nice garlicky flavour.  The steak was a little over done and seemed dried (ordered medium rare so expected tender and juicy). Old Hy's usually someone would ask how are steaks were, that didn't happen here (but being in a hurry I didn't send it back).The potato's were also under seasoned.  No offer of pepper or steak sauce. The old Hy's was consistently great, but for the price I think you'd find a better steak at the Keg to be honest than this new location.

The large dining space has a traditional gentleman's lounge feel with dark wood interior, dim lighting, book shelves everywhere, and plush seating of different heights. Washrooms and private dining rooms are located downstairs - which are accessible by stairs and elevator. Food-wise, we split a 20oz bone-in ribeye steak with fries, keylime pie, bourbon chocolate cake and a decaf coffee. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare - super juice, marbled and tender, with a beautiful char on its exterior. The fries was chunky and crispy. Lightly seasoned which I enjoyed. The bourbon was surprisingly good in the chocolate cake! It was strong, but works very well. I'm a big fan of keylime pie though, so that was my favourite dessert of the night. Would return to try other things on the menu! Price is more expensive. So it's only a special occasion place for me. Nice to come for a treat once in a while!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"A disclaimer for this review: I don't eat red meat, so all I know of the quality of the steak here is the opinion of my team with whom I had a work lunch here. Unfortunately, the overall consensus was not favourable and everyone felt that the steak was not up to the standard expected of a restaurant like this one. I ordered the lobster cobb salad, which looked lovely at first glance but tasted absolutely horrific. The ingredients did not seem fresh at all, and the tiny handful of lobster was dressed with the strangest mayo-ish mixture that I couldn't even describe - and not in a good way. There was something extremely off putting about it and I was definitely not a fan. In addition, there was bacon in the salad despite my mentioning of diet restrictions above; I noticed after a couple of bites and picked the bits out myself. Desserts were pretty mediocre - the bananas foster came with a cool show which we dutifully applauded, but was certainly not worth the price. The only redeeming feature of the meal was the cheese toast, which was drenched in the most delicious layer of cheesiness and almost melted in my mouth. Both the service and ambiance were outstanding - there wasn't much of a crowd and the waitstaff pretty much catered to our every request: explaining the menu in detail, topping up water without having to be asked, promptly delivering food to our table, and overall just being extremely professional.

Let me first start off by saying that the service here is impeccable and the interior is modern and chic. We were a group of . You're able to tell them if you'd like certain dishes specifically, or omitted, and if you have a preference with more seafood or more meats. We started the night with some drinks that were refreshing and tasty. First off, the tasting menu is SO worth it at $, the portions are HUGE and we were stuffed by the end of it. Now, onto the good stuff that were served based on our preference (we like both seafood and meats): Dry Aged Amberjack Aguachile: 10\/10 - Amberjack was fresh and came with a citrusy sauce that was a great appy to start the meal with. Sikil Pak: 10\/10 - The presentation of this was very interesting, with cabbage poking out from the dish, but it was absolutely packed with nutty flavours. Scallop Ceviche: 9\/10 - Came in a black sauce so it was hard to see the ingredients. Still enjoyed this but the dry aged amberjack was definitely a lot better. Memela: 8\/10 - A dish of mushrooms, pea, ramp, roots, etc. It's a earthier dish that was good but not my favourite of the night Empanada Oaxaquena :1000\/10 - My absolute favourite dish of the night. Imagine this as a big taco to share for the table. The flavours are complex, bold and so delicious. Definitely get this dish when you dine here. Newfoundland Scallops: 10\/10 - Fresh scallops with a delicious sauce. This is a one biter that was packed with flavour in the sauce it was cooked in. 14oz Ribeye: 10\/10 - Great for sharing since the slices are already cut for you. The salt on the side was a great touch to the steak with the perfect saltiness. Whole Seabream: 10\/10 - I'm not usually a big fan of whole seabream but this was another delicious dish to the table! Also look how impressive it is to have a whole fish! Mushroom: 10\/10 - Charred mushrooms that had a delicious smokey taste. The creama sauce was a great compliment to the mushrooms. Savoy cabbage: 10\/10 - Another great smokey dish that was hearty, earthy and so tasty. To end off the meal, we got the epazote respado which was so refreshing, light and perfect for the tasting menu. For a tasting menu of this price and being a michelin star restaurant, this really blew me away. The flavours were all so great, such big portions for the table and the service was incomparable to any I've had. I definitely highly recommend this spot, either for a special occasion or for a regular dine in! What a well deserved Michelin star!","Sentiment":"positive"}

We also had a complimentary birthday slice of tres leches cake, which had the lightest taste of leche (the chocolate cream was overpowering). The waitress brought out two small memelas informing us one large one would not be enough to share which we thought was thoughtful (we were charged for 1.). With the seabream, duck, and ribeye, we were also given tortillas to make tacos with. When they realized , they offered to bring us more - we questioned if this was an extra charge or another thoughtful gesture. We were told it would not be an extra charge (it was!).

{"Review Text":"Really great pizza and nice cozy atmosphere. I ordered the 'nduja which had spicy sausage, mozzarella, tomato sauce, fresh basil and garlic. It was quite tasty, my only \"complaint\" would be I wish it had a bit more sausage on it. It was very sparse and had maybe one piece per slice. Fried calamari was perfectly battered and seasoned. Light, crispy and fresh. I loved the slightly sweet but spicy sauce it came with. All in all, we really enjoyed it and I will be back. Just be mindful that you will have to find street parking.","Sentiment":"positive"}

If I knew about the happy hour beforehand, I would have left work early. Looks like all appies are 1\/. The decor was not bad. It is quite nicely decorated. Seating was comfy. We ended up sitting in a booth. I got the Lobster Black Truffle roll and substituted the fries with lobster bisque. The lobster bisque was a bit disappointing. It had a burnt taste.

I added an xtra 2oz of Lobster & xtra 2oz of truffle sauce. Man this was one EXPENSIVE SANDWICH! All in it was $45. + tax & tip ($60.00)!! The most expensive sandwich I've ever eaten.

Overall would come back again and the pineapple mojito was delicious.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I stopped in for a beer at LBB after finding Mascot Brewery c\/w Yelp check in offer for beer flights closed unexpectedly. It's up the stairs, and easy to find right across the street from Roy Thompson Hall. My experience here was very pleasant with each interaction with staff a pleasure. I would happily recommend this spot as somewhere to take people from out of town after walking around this entertainment district downtown. It's a nice alternative from the typical noisy and flashy sports bar or British pub, with soft lighting, quiet music and generally chill atmosphere. Where I sat at the bar it was a beautiful spot indeed. There are several beers on tap, so I picked an IPA and enjoyed that. Pints are on the pricy side, $, and since it is in a tourist area that should be expected and not out of line with other businesses. Love to go back and try some lobster dishes!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We tried this spot during Summerlicious. Was quite good if a little pricey. Candidly one of the things I like the best was the lobster bisque. It was the bomb. I did have a lobster truffle roll. It was quite nice although pretty thin on the lobster. Very tasty with the fries though. I would recommend. The desserts were very good, a peanut butter cheesecake and a chocolate lava cake. Both were excellent and quite filling. This restaurant is located right on King West, so there is no parking on the street. You can however get there easily by transit, or you can park in Roy Thompson Hall which is close by.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I liked some of the food but overall the food is just ok, nothing really special or memorable which would make me revisit. We got bread and olives with feta to start. The olives tasted horrible and I live olives. For my main I got the steak with truffle Parmesan fries.  The fries were delicious but the steak with mushrooms and asparagus was bland. No seasoning, steak was over cooked and dry. For dessert we got a variety to share: macarons, flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake. Dessert was yummy. Overall, the food was ok. I think it's still a great place to visit. I would like to try this place again to give it another chance and choose another dish. Overall, it was good.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Fairly tasty food, though prices are a bit high and service can be slow. Had a lovely dinner here. Strangely, a bit of a wait to be seated, despite having a reservation and there being plenty of open tables. We had requested a booth seat in the notes, and while the hostess initially showed us to a standard 2-top, they then moved us without further prompting. We got started with some cocktails: the strawberry fields, a rum-based drink, and the moonbeam, an Earl Grey & gin concoction. The strawberry fields tasted quite strong, with more rum flavour than the colour and presentation might have you expect. The moonbeam, meanwhile, was pleasantly light and sweet, with lots of Earl Grey coming through. A decently long wait later, we got our appetizers: fish tacos, beef tartare, and herbed frites with Dijon aioli (not pictured... oops). The beef tartare was the standout star, and the fries were also fantastic. The fish tacos were... fine? I would skip them next time, but I'm also spoiled by the quality of Mexican cuisine in California. The waiter mentioned specifically that today's tacos were halibut, and asked if that was okay--so perhaps the fish changes by day. Eventually we got our mains: the braised Beverly Creek lamb shank, and the Qu\u00e9bec wild boar chop. The lamb shank was supremely tender, practically flaking off with the touch of a fork. It was nicely seasoned, and the accoutrements were tasty as well, but frankly it was rather one-note. I liked the walnut pesto, but it was difficult to distribute across the meat. The wild boar chop was creative. We had asked about doneness, and were told it only came well done, but that didn't detract. It certainly took more effort than the lamb to slice off pieces to eat, but the flavours were excellent, and the strawberries provided a nice brightness to the dish. The garlic was also great; relatively mild, and so soft as to nearly melt when placed on the tongue. Our preferred dish of the evening, though I wish we had gotten the same crispy exterior that some other reviews rave about. Finally, we had the cheesecake. This tasted great, though I personally would have preferred a graham crust to the oatmeal one presented. The cheesecake itself is bare, requiring that you smear spoonfuls into the sauce yourself, but it was delicious. Overall, a great spot, but don't go ravenous -- you'll need to be prepared to wait a bit. Oh, and mind that the water is bottled, so expect to pay accordingly; next time, I'll just ask for tap instead of still.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"An elegant, upscale spot for a special night out-  went here for a work event -- service and food were on point! Only regret is that we had a set menu so couldn't try all the dishes on their regular menu Highlights: - Beef Wellington tenderloin steak: cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce and mushrooms and greens that were a delicious pairing - shrimp appetizer: plump juicy shrimp with tomato slices and a sauce that was really complimentary Less enthused: - flourless chocolate cake: mainly bc it seems a bit ganache like and thick and richer than expected but still yummy for the chocolate lover","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Always a great meal here. It's just north of Bloor on Cumberland, west of Bay. TTC stop us close by or there are numerous parking garages nearby for those that want to drive. It's more in the $$$ per person category, but if you go during Wibter or Summerlicious, you can get a nice 3-course meal for a great price. The restaurant is light and airy. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Food is always top notch and they have a nice wine list. Note that the pictures attached reflect a Summerlicious offering. We took friends that had never been before and they loved it too!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Decided to finally try this restaurant and thought what could be a better opportunity than summerlicious! Right of the back, well front :D, the new patio space can be seen. Bellair St. is now completely blocked for cars and provide more patio spaces for the surrounding restaurant and Sassafraz is one of those. This extra space allows for bigger patio tables since their original Bellair st patios allow for only tables of 2. The interior is classy and very spacious, I didn't expect it to be as spacious from how the facade looks. Sassafraz also gives off a relaxed ambiance with not-so-loud background music, very nice to have dinner or lunch with friends or family. I ordered the Pistachio crusted ahi tuna salad for starter, Quebec wild boar chop as main, and flourless chocolate cake as dessert. All of these are part of their regular menu, which is nice, it's just that the tuna salad is usually part of their main course instead of an appetizer or salad. I was a little scared that the wild boar chop was going to taste gamey, but that wasn't the case at all. It was very tender and juicy! I would say the overall taste was great, especially the wild boar chop! The ahi tuna pieces on the salad were a little thin and the avocado overpowered the taste of the ginger vinaigrette. For those chocolate lovers out there, the flourless chocolate cake hits home. It was rich and velvety, it coats your mouth just nice and wasn't overly sweet. This cake went exceptionally well with the red sangria that I ordered. The sangria helped cleaned the mouthfeel in between bites.","Sentiment":"positive"}

We also ordered a charcuterie board but they missed the delivery & it arrived AFTER our main course so we turned it away. I ordered the sausage\/mushroom zah.

AMAZING. highly recommend all. By far the best tasting caprese salad that doesn't shy down on its portions or cheese slices. Fresh and light. The pizzas were done quite quickly maybe about a . Would need a fork and a knife to cut into it because the toppings weigh down the bread a bit. Crust\/appetizers\/bread is very very good with the hot garlic sauce provided. If I could buy it I would! If you're not a fan of hot it might come off as really spicy. But the flavour is strong and works well with the breads for sure! Bread is fresh, with a perfect crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Price- fairly priced! About $12-. Nothing heavy on the pocket. Service & environment- Amazing. Waitress kept checking up on us, let us sit near the tv to watch the Jays game. Made sure our water jug was never empty. Accommodated us really well!

The first was with the classic tomato sauce and had Flor di latte, mozzarella, and a few other ingredients that slip my mind at the moment. It was absolutely deliciously, cooked perfectly with just enough sauce. You had to finish the crust too! The other pizza was bianche, with olive oil.

{"Review Text":"It was time for Perfect Pizza Quest iteration numero 6.  This is a UYE primarily organized by Namrata of YelpGTA fame. This night was converged upon by about a dozen willing participants at the area of Bathurst north of Bloor and south of Dupont at Napoli Centrale who on their website claim they are authentic Neopolitan which I'm realizing isn't that unique anymore in TO.  There are quite a few establishments who have this claim (VPN). The dining area is deceivingly spacious and open.  You wouldn't know it by looking at the storefront but the inside is particularly wide and well lit.  The bar is to the right as you enter and the oven and prep area is open concept as well.  If you have a large 800+ degree oven you want to show that baby off am I right?  Some of the countertops around the oven appear to be treated concrete!  How cool is that? At the table we had , we already had water decanters as well as sliced pizza dough bread with olives and some type of pepper sauce.  The sauce is really tasty, it's as if they are in little baby food jars and I couldn't quite figure out what kind of peppers they used.  The color looked to be Scotch bonnet but they weren't that hot.  I should have asked.  The taste was great though, not too hot at all but tasty enough to dip with the bread AND use when you eat the crust of your pizza. I started off with a salad as did my wife.  I had ordered a Grotto Azzura (Arugula, prosciutto, shaved parmesan, lemon and olive oil dressing) and she had the Mergellina (Mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, shaved carrot, corn, tuna, green olive, mozzarella).  The salads came in full size toss bowls.  They were large, I should have figured that since each was about 't ready for that size, just a small portion.  I ended up sharing mine out.  Each came with a serving tong. For pizza I had ordered the Diavolo (rossa) as I normally do at these types of places (Smoked provolone, hot soppressata salami) and my wife had ordered a Napoletana (bianche - Sausage, rapini and fior di latte). I had mine and a slice of hers.  Both were very good.  I enjoy this type of pizza being that it's thin and chewy.  The crust at the edge seems a little thick but it's still good.  I used the hot sauce they provided to eat with the crust which was just great.  The Diavolo had a very nice salty taste to it.  The salami was nice and spicy and the overall flavor was rich with spice and bite to it.  The Napoletana was of course not as spicy since the sausage is much more bland but the rapini is a great combo with any pork in my books.  It was good but having the tongue for spice I have to say I enjoyed mine much more. Over all the service was friendly.  It would have nice to not have to ask for more bread and water though but the service was still good and the food was what you would expect if a place claims to be VPN certified.  I enjoyed it at Napoli Centrale.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Located about 1., in a quieter part of The Annex is this relaxed, casual, and warm pizza joint. Homemade segments of bread with a roasted red pepper\/cheese spread and green\/black olives were complimentary. (I must mention this, but at the bottom of the bread basket was a napkin...that was stained with the red pepper dip, underneath the bread.  After that discovery, I sorta stopped eating the free bread.) Ordered:  Ortolano (grilled veg) and Cappriosca pizza.  Both pizzas were pretty thin crust.  Sauce was fresh tasting.  Good portion as I was only the eat half of the pizza.  Really good pizza at a decent cost in a cozy spot!","Sentiment":"positive"}

All of us received our meals about the same time but mine came out to be rare instead of blue. Although I had trouble finding our waiter, he quickly resolved the issue but taking my steak and told me that the kitchen will make it right. He kept the sides so I could munch on but took my fork where i had to grab a new set from the empty table next to us. When the new steak finally came, it was cooked right plus all the sides including the shrimp and scallop that was part of my order. To my surprise, the manager was the one who served my new plate as well as mentioned that my meal would not be on the bill as I had to eat alone since my group finished their meal waiting for me.

They don't take reservations, but if you get there early it's fairly easy to get a table. Their patio is cute with umbrellas to shade you. The service was attentive and friendly.

We liked his recommendations ... they had a bold taste. Then we tried Julia's flight.  We liked Julia's ... they were smooth but not as bold-tasting as Kal's. It was fun to try the different rums this way as we could actually taste them since they weren't masked by pop.  And it's a good way to check out higher-end rums than we usually drink.

You want to get some knowledge about rums?  Come here!  Basically I think everyone should check this place out with the intention of trying out some new brands.  Once you've had a good quality rum you will never go back to the cheap stuff.  It goes down smooth, like velvet...instead of a 3rd degree burn. The service as many others have mentioned is a bit lackluster.  I know they are busy but we waited awhile for our bill, even asking for it twice.  Since we were on a time crunch and had dinner reservations we ended up going to the back to pay at the small counter.

Pro tip for the tsukemen - ask for a small bowl of clear broth once you're done with the noodles. It is free of charge, and you can pour it in the tsukemen broth to thin it out without losing the flavor - gives you delicious drinkable broth!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Went here for their anniversary event. It was pretty busy and the restaurant is a bit cramped. We were seated pretty quickly. I think their ramen is a bit more pricy than average, with the cheapest being around $18. For the anniversary event, we got a small snack (a Koala's March bag) and a free pop. I thought it was a bit sad, but there were other goods such as $, sapporo goods, so it's probably just me being a sore loser. Our servers were short with us but they checked in and were attentive. It seemed like they were pretty frustrated with us. My boyfriend ordered the spicy red miso and I ordered the red miso. His ramen came first, and I had to wait a few minutes for mine to come (probably because of the modifications I asked for). The red miso is very, very rich. I liked it, but I can also see how it may be too salty for some. It came with some minced pork, onions and chashu (as a picky eater, I removed the other stuff). The chashu was soft and really good. My boyfriend said his was good, and the heat stayed on his mouth when he ate. The total came out to $. Overall, a decent ramen place. Would love to go again when there is an event.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"It's hard to get good ramen in Philadelphia and after seeing good reviews for Ramen Isshin, I'm glad we stopped by. My girlfriend got the white sesame shio and I got the asari light shoyu. The broth of the white sesame shio definitely has the sesame flavor and isn't as savory as the asari light shoyu but it was still delicious. It tasted clean and had depth enough to coat the noodles and provide enough flavor. As for the asari light shoyu, it was savory and of course, lighter than what I'd imagine, the other broths. The broth was creamy for sure and closer to the traditional ramen experience. I love the depth and richness of the broth. It wasn't too salty either. The whole bowl felt cohesive and each component complemented each other. I'd be more than happy if there was a location in Philadelphia! I will be thinking of Ramen Isshin fondly when reflecting on notable ramen places!","Sentiment":"positive"}

I ordered a cold white sesame tantan noodle.s It was a summer special. The broth was cold and refreshing, with a touch of spiciness though a bit salty. I loved their thick wavy noodles, always chewy! Lots of toppings that went with the ramen. It was good but I could hardly taste the sesame flavour. Overall, almost every was good except I was not happy with one of the waitresses. She was rude and had an attitude when I asked if there was any wifi available and when she refilled my glass of water.","Sentiment":"negative"}

{"Review Text":"I was downtown with a friend to attend a show at Roy Thomson Hall and we were looking for a place to grab a quick, light, and inexpensive bite before the show. That's not always easy to find in this neighbourhood. We ended up at Lee Chen Bistro, right across the street from the theatre. It turned out to be a great spot! We had their Braised Pork Belly Over Rice and Spicy Beef Tendon. Both dishes were very flavourful and priced right at 8..99, respectively. The service was good, friendly and efficient. I guess they cater to a lot of theatre-goers waiting to catch a show. They even have robots delivering food to diners. The restaurant, including the washroom, was very clean. I'd come back to try more from their menu! PS: The show was excellent and the theatre was gorgeous!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Food: was rather bland. Pad Thai was missing several layers of flavor, but the noodles were good. The beef and broccoli had a nice portion of broccoli and beef, but like the pad Thai there was little flavor. Service: indifferent.

The soup dumplings appear to be the speciality but it was too hot both inside and outside for me to think about ordering them.","Sentiment":"positive"}

NEVER AGAIN AT THIS PLACE.","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Highly disappointing. We got soup dumplings, fried pork dumplings, beef and broccoli and general Tsos shrimp. Everything was just off. The soup dumplings came with an orange vinegar sauce instead of a ponzu- type sauce and the meet inside was not a cohesive ball. They were also incredibly small. The pan fried pork dumplings came with the same sauce which was disappointing. The beef and broccoli was inedible. It came out Luke warm in a gelatinous clear yellowish sauce. The general tsos shrimp was described as lightly bartered on the menu. There was , it was covered in onions and we sent it back.  Weirdest general Tsos I have ever ordered. I needed to eat something shortly after leaving to get the taste of the beef and broccoli goop out of my mouth. Everything comes out on a robot that the waiter has to unload the food from so there is no point to the robot. Everything came out so fast that I honestly think it was microwaved. Rice is extra. Multiple thumbs down on this place and I don't know how the reviews are so high.","Sentiment":"negative"}

{"Review Text":"Came here with a friend to try out this Indian fusion restaurant. Service was normal, not super fast but very friendly as they also take your coats for you. It was warm inside and dark, really setting a nice ambience for a date night. The food was good but not outstanding. Although it's considered an Indian fusion restaurant, some dishes (duck breast) didn't taste very Indian. We ordered the Pukka Chaat, which was flavourful and with a tiny kick of spice. We also ordered the duck breast with blueberry curry, but the curry was more of a jam in my opinion. Finally we got the pumpkin curry which was delicious but it is mildly spiced.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I've been to Pukka twice now, one time for Winterlicious back in . Both experiences have been wonderful! Food: I honestly enjoyed all the dishes I had from Pukka. From my recent visit, the chaat is a yummy appetizer to go for when you want a refreshing mix of textures. The Boatman's Fish and Prawns and Punjabi Chicken Curry were each distinct and so flavourful. The Boatman's Fish and Prawns reminded me of a seafood bisque - the taste is different though - more of a turmeric and lemon-coconut curry base. The portion of garlic naan could have been more but did not disappoint. Service\/atmosphere: The waitress who served us was patient, and gave amazing customer service that was welcoming. I hope Pukka considers opening a brunch menu at their restaurant, I still remember the pakora-eggs benedict they served when Ji (their brunch restaurant) was open back then.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I can confidently say that I was not ready for this knock out meal. My coworkers and I got a last minute call up to this meal when there were last minute cancellations which was just fine with us. Our dinner was served to us in a tasting menu style. We started off with a few different appetizers. There were sweet potato samosas with a duo of chutneys and a colourful Chaat that was piled high. There was also a spicy chili chicken app which I could only manage a few bites of due to low spice tolerance. The main course was a medley of curries with baskets of all kinds of naan - plain, whole wheat, and garlic (the tastiest one!). Of the mains, my favourite were the lamb chops that were served on a butter based sauce. The lamb itself was grilled to perfection and I didn't care how full I was - I wasn't leaving any of it on the plate. We were treated to two desserts. The first was a chili chocolate cake that was served with a scoop of raspberry sorbet. The flavours were too complex for me to appreciate. The spice was definitely there. I did really appreciate the sorbet though. The second was a pavlova topped with edible flowers and berries. This was the perfect consistency and a great way to end a super filling meal. The last thing to touch on are the beverages. I ordered a mango lass with my meali. It's served in a smaller glass for good reason. This lassi is pretty thick, almost like a smoothie but very, well, smooth! It's definitely a little filling on it's own which probably explains the smaller size. With dessert I ordered a masala chai tea. It's served in a cute lightbulb glass. Sugar was offered with it but I really liked it just as it was. Final final thing, the ambiance in the restaurant is pretty nice. It's a modern interior with huge doors that can open up onto the patio facing St Clair which helps with airflow. We went on the hottest day of the year (so far) so that really helped with comfort.","Sentiment":"positive"}

We had the Summerlicious with Gobi 65, eggplant, chicken Tikka Masala, and the rice pudding. The cauliflower was delicious. Deep fried with chiles, masala spice, and lots of garlic.  The eggplant was a close second although the cracker had an odd texture. The CTM was odd.  We have had CTM in London and multiple cities in the US.  This version was very thick and sweet. I also think it included a nut butter, probably peanut.  It was not bad but I prefer other versions more.  The chicken was well cooked though. Rice pudding was good.

I ordered the duck confit pizza which interestingly comes with pear slices as a topping. The crust was thin and crispy, but I think the pear was a weird combination with the duck. It wasn't horrible, perhaps it's just my preference of not having hot fruit paired with meat and pizza. Perhaps I should have picked a more basic flavour? All in all, the pizza was on the pricier side, small portioned and tasted just decent. I probably wouldn't go out of my way again for this pizza..","Sentiment":"positive"}

Hadn't visited since before the pandemic, so it was nice to see it very busy on this night. We were seated downstairs as a result. The space is nice, but it's more quiet and intimate. It doesn't have the same vibe as upstairs, so if you're on a date, or want a quiet dinner, ask to be seated there. We had delicious traditional Neapolitan pizzas, pizzas, beet and burrata salad appetizers. The service was excellent as usual, but you should be aware that they've changed the menu.  They've added new style pizzas and taken pasta off the menu. It was a little disappointing as I always enjoyed their gnocchi. Overall I recommend this place. A little pricy, but worth it.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Quarantine Day 1: After a long and hectic travel schedule, I needed a lot of food but also something healthy to treat my body right. That means pizza and a salad! I ordered off UberEats for this delivery. All of the food was packaged in compostable packaging. The pizza boxes were sealed with a sticker. I did like that the dressings and sauces were nestled in with the food it was supposed to go with. Sometimes they are all included on the side and I'm not sure what to match with what. The Caprese Salad was very fresh and bright. The heirloom tomatoes were thick sliced and meaty. The mozzarella equally so. I only used half the dressing but it was light enough that the flavours of the individual ingredients really came through. The Funghi pizza had a creamy sauce and had an earthy flavour with all the mushrooms. The Pepperoni was a little more what you'd expect with a red sauce and mozzarella but hit the spot perfectly. Both pizzas were a thinner crust. I liked the crust a lot since it wasn't crisped like a cracker and it wasn't bread-like.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I just wanted a simple marghuerita pizza, made the old fashioned way and not the chain pizza way. We decided to pick Pizzeria Libretto based on yelp reviews from other pizza\/Italian joints. SO WE GOT HERE. It seemed really busy. It took them . The servers were nice. We ordered the prosciutto di parma & arugula - basil, mozzarella, grand padano and arugula. Honestly the pizza was bleh, my friend liked it. We should've went with the doppia marghuerita. BUT the star of the meal was the bread they served us before the meal. I kid you not, I thought the bread was amazingly delicious and better than the actual 'za. I asked one of the servers what kind of bread it is and he said it's the rosemary focaccio. He even offered to sell it to me if there's leftovers at the end of the night. I'm like, alright! We were one of the two tables left at the end of the night and he brings out this gigantic loaf of bread. The server asks me how I'd like it to be cut, but then I asked him how much it would be. He said it was complimentary - WHAT?! I responded with, OKAY I'll take half then. I'll honestly say it's the best bread I've ever had in my life. It's soft and fresh on the inside. Very aromatic from the rosemary. And that's how I carried my food baby home.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"So overall I gave this place , but tbh the food was 5\/5. It's the service and atmosphere which were lacking. We were a party of two and had a reservation which we'd mentioned was an anniversary. This is because at the time of calling we were asked if it was a special occasion and we said anniversary. When we arrived, the booth we were given wasn't cleaned - not a big issue, mistakes happen. We asked a busser to quickly wipe it down at which point we were given our menus. At no point in the meal were we given a card, app, dessert, or any indication of acknowledgement it was our anniversary. This isn't a requirement, but if they ask at the time of booking, you'd think they might have done something. It took awhile for our orders to be taken, and also quite a while for our drinks to arrive. Again, this might have just been a combo of bad luck, but our food took a very long time to come out. To be fair it was a busy night, but we'd asked to have the dinner expedited as we had tickets to a nearby show, and when we made the reservation we thought 1., get our food and be on our way out. The food itself was very good, reasonably priced and the sticky toffee pudding was the highlight, but overall based solely on the service we recieved, I wouldn't return.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Icelandic Cod tasted fantastic - there was a kick of sour chili to the dish, and the cumin was prominent. AAA Flatiron Steak was also delicious; the steak was cooked perfectly to my taste, and the sauce they served it in was good.

Canadian combo was more expensive and was great to try bc there's a huge variety in the flavors of the oysters but we actually enjoyed the malpequest most even though they were cheapest, bc they were the biggest and tasted super fresh as well.

{"Review Text":"Pleasant Date Night Experience at Joey's Eaton Centre My boyfriend and I decided to try out Joey's for our date night, and we were pleasantly surprised by our experience. Despite not having a reservation, the staff promptly seated us within , which was a great start to the evening. The menu offered a variety of options, and my boyfriend opted for the Mediterranean plate. He thoroughly enjoyed the dish, noting that it was nice and fresh. As for me, I went with my go-to favourite, the butter chicken. It was as delicious as ever, reaffirming why it's my favourite choice at Joey's. The highlight of the night was definitely the Mediterranean plate, and I'm already planning to order it for myself on our next visit because it was simply outstanding. While the service was decent initially, it became a bit forgetful as the restaurant got busier. Our waiter seemed to have overlooked our bill, causing a minor inconvenience. Despite this hiccup, the overall ambiance and quality of the food made up for the lapse in service.

It is super tight walkways and the bathroom is downstairs FYI in case you have accessibility needs. They have bag hooks under the counter as well as coat hooks in the back of the restaurant. Service was nice and very quick. The fish was fresh. My favourites were the scallop temaki and uni toast. I loved the black cod dish - crispy skin and super tender meat. The croquettes were a pleasant surprise! The cheese wasn't overpowering at all and overall super tasty.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Came to Omai for girl's night and tried the tasting menu for $. Unfortunately the food was a bit disappointing. The flavors for some of the dishes didn't work and just wasn't balanced. Like the mango sauce on the scallop sashimi just didn't work well, the sauce overpowered the scallops and didn't allow the protein to shine, since scallops is mild tasting going with such a strong sauce just didn't do it justice. The black cod and wagyu were okay, it was a bit of a let down, it's not as tender and soft as I anticipated. Items from their menu that I did enjoy though, the oysters, the uni on toast, king salmon sashimi, and bluefin tuna temaki were good. The service was okay, our waitress was nice but she did forget to bring us a few items here and there. We also weren't given plates or cutlery when they started serving the first course for our tasting menu, we had to request it. The ambiance was modern and cozy, it's a smaller restaurant but the space is beautifully decorated. I had came to Omai before and did enjoy their food, that's why I decided to come back and try the tasting menu. Unfortunately I don't think their tasting menu is worth it. If I were to go back I'd probably stick to a la carte. Since for the price of their tasting menu, there are better options out there.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Tried the tasting menu ($85\/person) and it was such a lovely experience. There were , and I ordered a yuzu beer. Seafood was fresh, and the everything was perfectly cooked. My favourites would be their Uni Toast (MUST TRY), and Miso black cod dish. Staffs were very kind and attentive, and the atmosphere was great. The low lighting, and Japanese city pop faintly playing in the background, makes this the perfect date spot. The portions are quite small so do plan to eat a little before, or after the tasting. Though it was an expensive eat, I will DEFINITELY be returning.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We were running a bit late for our 8:, but we actually didn't end up getting seated until half an hour later. They also had to move us to another table to accommodate a party of four, but they did warn us ahead of time, and they comped our first round of drinks, which was nice of them. We were hoping to do the tasting menu because we really wanted the uni toast (which they ran out of) but they said most of the tasting menu items were gone, and we had to order a la carte. So if you're looking to do the tasting menu as well, make sure you get an earlier reservation. We ended up ordering a few items: -Caviar oyster - the oyster was fine. I liked the hot sauce in the little bottle that it was served with -Blue fin tuna hand roll - this was really good. I liked the fried shallots it was topped with. It was a nice change from the typical green onion -Salmon hand roll - this was great as well. I recently started liking ikura, so that was a nice touch -Flat iron wagyu - this was probably the worst dish of the night. It came smothered in some sauce, reminiscent of the teriyaki kitchen entrees you'd get at a sushi takeout restaurant. It masked the taste of the beef, which makes me wonder about the quality and if it was even wagyu at all Maybe my experience would have been difference had I gotten to try the tasting menu. But it's hard to judge when menu items are limited. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back though.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Food: had the $85\/person prix fixe dinner along with the additional futomaki. Everything was delicious. The scallop sashimi, uni toast, and futomaki were my favourites. The lemon meringue tart was delicious but it was a bummer that when two people do the prix fixe they must share just one tarte. In general delicious and interesting combinations for a special occasion but portions are on the small end and I was still hungry after. Service: friendly and attentive. The chefs were cooking in the front and everyone was lovely. I'm glad I went! It was a great experience.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I recently tried the tasting menu from Omai and it was super tasty! - Uni on Squid Ink Toast w\/caviar - Bluefin Tuna hand roll - Oysters and Sashimi - Croquette w\/mushroom, oka cheese and truffle mayo - Cod - American Wagyu w\/Yu Choy - Lemon Meringue Pie Everything was absolutely delicious! The standouts for me were the uni toast, tuna handrolls and the wagyu. The uni was super fresh and creamy... it was the perfect bite with the buttery and salty toast! As for the tuna handroll, I thought the seaweed and rice gave the perfect balance of texture with the fatty tuna. The wagyu was cooked a perfect medium rare and still had the char on the outside. Overall, I wish the portions were bigger but I was still satisfied because the dishes were all so tasty! Tasting Menu: $85\/pp before tip and tax","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Came back for a sit-down service and I think overall, the food items here are good but ridiculously overpriced. There are much better sushi options in the city for a fraction of the Omai prices, but I guess you pay for the ambience (which tbh, is nice). Some notes: - Miso black cod was WAY too salty but the fish was delicious - Scallop handroll is a MUST TRY - Chirashi don was just OK","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This review is from our takeout experience only. We ordered the scallop maki, bluefin tuna maki, and the toro tuna maki. The scallop maki was probably my favourite out of the batch for the price. I really liked the apple in the sushi for sure- it provided a similar texture to cucumber but with a hint of sweetness. The bluefin tuna roll wasn't that good- I wouldn't get that again. The toro tuna maki was good, but for the price there are definitely sushi places in the city that give you a larger portion. Would come back to try diff things, probably for sit-down.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"The Royal Appetizer is our favorite to order. This dish is not meant to be shared as you get four small but tasty pieces of shish kebab. Our favorite was the small wonton. I wanted to eat ! We also ordered the Mieng Pla (whole snapper baked in sea salt with Thai garlic, Thai basil, finger mint, peanuts, ginger, scallions and lime in Thai kale leaves). - This dish was light and refreshing. There was nothing wrong with it, but it fell short for me. It wasn't my cup of tea. Sometimes the bites can feel salty. But our favorite main dish is savory! Gaeng Boombai Nua (Braised AAA Wellington County Beef Ribs with Tamarind, Field Cucumber and Pearl Onions). When it comes to our entrees, savory is king. The meat in this dish was tender and melted in your mouth. Even the huge bones looked majestic! The restaurant was beautifully decorated. I would like to try this alcoholic drink next time. It's beautiful.","Sentiment":"positive"}

We ordered moo ping, dumpling, boat noodles, pad Thai chicken and chicken fried rice. On the drinks we ordered the owliang ( Thai coffee) All the food were really good. I really enjoyed the moo ping and It's one of my favourite Thai dishes. Service was amazing, our server was always checking up on us and ensuring we taken cared of.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"As soon as I sat down at Kiin, I was in awe of its interior design, including the ornate lighting, custom ceramic cutlery rests, and usage of bright colours. This feeling continued throughout the meal as I felt like I was in an intersection of Asian royalty, the Victorian era, and a cottage core aesthetic. Coming from the same owners as Pai, I had high expectations. I ordered the Khao Mun Gai\/Gai Tawd (Thai-style Hainanese ginger-garlic rice with chicken, winter melon soup) and a Cha Chug, Thai pulled milk tea. The food was hearty but didn't blow me away, and the drink was a little too sweet. However, the overall experience was good and I'd definitely come back to try their brunch items.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Based on the reviews, I had expected to be wowed. On first impression, the interior was nicely decorated with lovely furniture, flatware, and details. We got the traditional Thai breakfasts. Both were very underwhelming. The jhok was the flavourful, but the egg based breakfast really was meh. Two unseasoned fried eggs with a bit of minced meat and sliced sausages (which are easily bought pre-made from grocery stores).  While the price is comparable to other places, it wasn't worth it.  We were also disappointed by the Thai tea...too sweet and too little tea flavour. Overall, decent service, nice furniture,  interior, underwhelming food that I wouldn't go back for (and that doesn't even make me curious about the other items).","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Best Thai branch I've ever had, and it was such a unique experience overall! My group had a reservation and we were seated immediately after arrival. Interior was so cute and a mood lift! The menu was attractive, and I had a hard time deciding which dish I want to get. It features traditional Thai food, with a bunch of Thai drinks, including espresso drinks. I loved the congee. All ingredients and spices go well together!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I've never had Thai breakfast before, and being somewhat of a brunch enthusiast, I immediately made a reservation when I found out that Kiin now does brunch! When I first stepped into Kiin I fell in love with the light airy aesthetic of the place, everything was so beautiful. We started with the Rama Caesar, which tastes like a regular Caesar but with Tom Yum soup as a base. The Thai iced coffee was also pretty good but I found it quite similar to Vietnamese iced coffee. We got all three of the brunch items and they were spectacularly presented and tasted equally as good. I especially enjoyed the Thai crullers that came with the Khai Kratha. We ended the meal with some donuts and they were also very good. While I wouldn't say the brunch was the best food I've ever had, dining at Kiin was definitely an exciting culinary experience. Thai breakfast was something I've never tried before, the aesthetic of the restaurant was pleasing and the service attentive. Overall a great experience.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Our party of , ready to fill our bellies. We started with some ok drinks, Royal Dumpling Platter, and Deep Fried Clams. The platter was something I really looked forward to try, and it was tasty for the most part. I liked the soft dumpling, and it was gorgeous and you could see the adept craftsmanship. The clams were delicious as well. Can't go wrong with deep fried anything! We shared the Smoked Duck Breast - really tasty, Pan Seared Roti - okay, Pork Jowl - okay, and Soft Shell Crab - really good. For dessert, we shared the Roti and Condensed Milk - meh, Taro Cake - meh, and Coconut Ice Cream with Pandan and Sago - great! I was excited to try out Kiin's interesting menu and it was good, but not really memorable.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Kiin is an authentic royal Thai restaurant that provides a creative and interesting dining experience. The restaurant's atmosphere is cozy and elegant, which creates a delightful ambiance for a night out. However, it should be noted that the prices are quite high, with some dishes being considerably more expensive than what you would expect to pay elsewhere. For example, the Khao Soi dish is typically much more affordable at other Thai restaurants, and at Kiin, it's significantly pricier. While the food is undoubtedly delicious and creatively prepared, the high prices may be a bit of a turn-off for some diners. Despite the high prices, Kiin is still an excellent option for those looking for an authentic Thai dining experience. The flavors are bold and authentic, like the pictured rice salad and dumplings. The restaurant's ambiance is lovely, with attentive service and a relaxing atmosphere that is perfect for an evening out with friends or family. Overall, Kiin is a great choice for those who are willing to pay a premium for a unique and high-quality dining experience. While the prices may be steep, the food and atmosphere make up for it, and it's definitely worth a visit if you're looking for an authentic royal Thai experience.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Our visit to Kiin was a really pleasant experience. We got there for our reservation at 11:45am for their brunch experience. We visited with a couple of close friends. The host was promptly and attentive to get us seated and with menu in hand very efficiently and friendly. We all order some drinks to get started, Greg had the Thai Iced Coffee and I got their Pandan-Butterfly Pea Latte. Both drinks were beautifully presented and delicious! Good size drinks for the price, I have to admit. For our food Greg ordered the traditional Thai breakfast dish of  JHOK, this was the most exciting part of our brunch experience, he liked that this was a different take on your typical Thai food. It felt fresh, authentic and very cool way to try something different, while maintaining that Thai flavour we were seeking. Me in the other hand ordered the KHAO MUN GAI which is part of the 'rice' section of their menu, for some reason I was expecting more, like a little \"wow\" factor to a very classic dish, but it was just a good take on fried chicken and aromatic rice, it was good, but not as worthy as our other option. Our friends both order the KHAI KRATHA and they both said that it was a different way of having eggs and pan fried Chinese sausage, but felt a little underwhelming for them. We finished our experience by ordering their Fresh Mini Donuts for the table to share and those we such a delicious and different way to end of a sweet treat. Would recommend getting all their three flavours, they can accommodate that into your order if you ask them. Their prices were fair at least for their brunch menu, we found it very comparable to other restaurants in the city. Overall our service felt real and authentically Thai. The space is really well decorated and with a good taste for Thai design. All their staff seemed knowledgeable and well verse on the menu. You can also tell their kitchen staff is determined in providing you with the best level of quality and delivery. We were able to get an intimate table, where all the four of us were able to chat and catch up comfortably, while enjoying a different take on Brunch! We will definitely need to try their dinner menu next time.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I am not vegan but someone was and they had extremely limited options. As for the food, overall it was decent but nothing spetacular. I did see the staff haul in some of their frozen pizzas, which I assume was to heat up and not made fresh at this location. I do have to applaud their octopus dish, it was tend and flavourful!

Alex made an off menu cocktail with rose water, gin and Elderflower liquor that was fantastic. The children piccata was two large breasts with salad on top and delicious. Enough for two persons. The Fun Guy mushroom pizza was excellent. Rich, very cheesy and a nice chewy wood fired dough ().

{"Review Text":"I have been looking forward to trying this place since I first passed by its chic painted exterior. The interior is even more contemporary than the outside, the walls are all beautifully designed with a different theme. The bar had this curved wall feature that extended to the ceiling, wow! This immediately set the expectations high for some nicely plated food. My one issue is with the menu, it was designed to look like a newspaper and made the items rather difficult to find, they were also quite beat up and ripped. Thankfully the food was not as raggedy as their menu. Burrata Con Funghi The burrata was amazing! It is one of my favourite cheese: not funky, tough on the outside, soft on the inside (just like me). The creaminess of the burrata enhanced the flavour surround it: the balsamic, olive oil, garlic and hazelnuts, mmmmm. There was also a good blend of textures: cheese, nuts, bread. The focaccia, was also amazing. Light fluffy and crispy on the outside, can't wait to come back for some more bread. Would recommend this dish. Egg Yolk Ravioli Was intrigued by the egg yolk ravioli from all the reviews here. How do they cook the ravioli without fully cooking the egg yolk? Careful attention must be paid to cooking the ravioli, especially with a shallow pot of water. The stuffing was heavy especially with the brown butter on it. Most of the ravioli was cooked, only the edges were undercooked. Nice to try, but I would not recommend especially if you don't like heavy foods. On the plus side, got some more focaccia to soak up that brown butter goodness. Roasted Sea Bass I thought there was only one way to eat sea bass (steamed) until I had this. They grilled and seasoned this fish to perfection. Bonus, served with some clams with basil and some tomato sauce. Fish was cooked just right, not over cooked. Skin was not charred but crispy well done. Would recommend. Piano Piano Spritz A welcome, refreshing drink. A bit sour for my liking. Would recommend to begin the meal, but not during the meal. The restaurant, the meal, the service was all very good. Definitely recommend, and I am looking forward to coming back! The veal parm looked good and huge, looking to get that next time!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Finally checked off this restaurant after many years. I heard many things about their egg yolk ravioli, and maybe I was expecting too much? I visited for lunch during their winterlicious promo, which comes with an appetizer, pasta or pizza & dessert. My friend and I ordered different items so we can try many dishes. We started with Burrata Con Funghi & calamari, both really good, burrata was light and refreshing and the Calamari was perfect. Moving to the 2nd course we got the egg yolk ravioli and sweet hornet pizza; sweet and savoury pizza was on point. The egg yolk pasta was somewhat healthy and not as heavy as it looked, but def too much for one person. I found a piece of plastic in the ravioli right when the server was checking in on us ... she handled it well by offering to send dish back\/ adjusting bill. Lastly, we were too full for dessert and decided to do take out  Nutella tiramisu; not too sweet and didn't taste the Nutella. Overall would come back for the pizza and try other pasta dishes.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I'm not going to list out everything I ate since I got a lot of skewers here.  The skewers are grilled nicely and very tender but they are very salty! I had to ask for less salt. My favorite skewers were the garlic prawn, chicken meatballs, the chicken thigh and leeks, Garlic stems wrapped Sliced in Pork, and the tofu. I also ordered the goma-ae (spinach), karaage, and the soy Yakionigiri.  The spinach was good, but I'd personally skip the karaage and yakionigri (it was okay but nothing special - get the skewers instead). The drinks are also reasonably priced at around $ $16.  Beware though, the skewers add up so expect to spend at least $40+ per person.  Each skewer is around $+. The service was good when I went.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"My favorite thai restaurant. I am a repeat customer (and reviewer...this is maybe my 3rd review because i tried different dish). Took a friend to try this place (he has hard time finding authentic one and dont want to go all the way to downtown).Lucky for me, a branch is open within 5min walk from my place!! so excited!! So we went to the newly opened location (still less than a month). Ordered: 1.padthai ...it never dissapoint. it hit the spot! it has nice tamarind flavor with subtle sweetness from palm sugar(authentic recipe!).very generous serving...squeeze lime to brighten up flavor. 2. tomyum noodle..wow..i like the type of noodle being used (which happen to be my favorite type. just dont know what is it called). broth is on point!!generous serving and beef. taste is 'real' (usually i eat tomyum instant noodle...lol). 3. fried pork jowl...this is new menu (the day we came was the 2nd day they try out this dish). wow..thats very refreshing and unique. crispy and juicy pork jowl..poured in some sort of pickled salsa? so it has bit of nice pickled juice on it too. for every jowl i eat, i 'drink' the pickled juice+bite the 'salsa'. that WAS REALLY good! refreshing...not 'picklish' overpowering.such a good balance after eating bit stronger flavor (from padthai tamarind and tomyum). in the past, every thai restaurants i go to, the pork jowl is served as is...with spicy chili thai on the side. so that pickled-juice poured over it is such a game changer(and much better than typical spicy chili thai). Friend now knows where to find legit thai food (to reminisce good time in thailand!) overall, consistent quality and service. definitely will be back and i already know exactly what i want to order next! lol","Sentiment":"positive"}

As usual, the taste was phenomenal, however I found Islamic Noodles tad too heavy for my liking with all that peanut gravy. Maybe it's better when shared along with some other thing to break its richness. My favourites on menu continue to be Pad Thai and Khao Soi.

{"Review Text":"Went here on a Sunday and overall would rate the place 7\/, We got the Chicken Massaman Curry Beef Khao Soi and Papaya salad. The Massaman curry was flavourful, had lots of meat in it. It was a pretty good curry but I'd say not my favourite Massaman curry. Beef Khao Soi was good, the flavours were bold. Papaya salad was really good as well! A little bit tangy due to the fish sauce\/vinegar but still overall really good. The service was good, we were seated right away and food came right away. Ambiance was pretty cool as they had paintings on the wall and made you feel like you were transported to a restaurant in Thailand. We got one thai iced tea as well which was good, tasted like regular thai iced tea. Our bill in total was about $. It is a little bit more expensive than we'd like to pay for Thai food, for the taste.. but would still come back here if we are even in the area and we are craving Thai food.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Food: : : : Stuffed Cluck Clucks has been on my list of places to try for ages but I have always been too lazy to make the trek. So I finally decided to make the trip and I must say that it was a mistake to procrastinate on this place. I had not really looked at the menu prior to coming in so it took me a bit of time to figure out what they offered and make a decision. I ended up going with the Twaco which is described as \"Boneless Breast, Jalapeno Cheddar Waffle, Shredded Cabbage, Fried Tortilla Strips, Cluck Sauce\" which sounded delicious. I also ordered a side of Chipotle fries which was unfortunately way too salty for my taste. The Twaco itself was pretty good as the chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The waffle had a fairly firm texture and the taste was ok, nothing mind blowing. Overall the Twaco was pretty good and would be something I'd order again but I will definitely skip the fries. Just to add another perspective, the friends I was with ordered only the fried chicken and they were praising it so I think we can all agree the chicken is good here. In terms of service, the gentleman who took our order was friendly and was ready to give us suggestions as he may have sensed this was our first time here. He also came by to wipe our table down when he noticed us cleaning some sauce off the table so definitely appreciated that. Other than that food was ready quickly so no complaints from me. The place wasn't too big but there's ample seating and everything was bright and clean. The smell of fried chicken in the air was also a delight especially when you're hungry. Well I am glad I made the trek down to Cluck Clucks as overall I enjoyed my food. I'll definitely be back and would recommend giving this place a try if you haven't been here already.","Sentiment":"positive"}

We also shared the Nashville chicken fries which were actually cold. They gave a good amount of sauce but I felt we would've enjoyed it more if the fries were freshly hot and crispy.

From the Clucks sauce to the juicy chicken, everything was perfect and exactly what we were craving. My wife and I joke that we still have dreams about the food.

The only thing left to do is indulge. And we did just that when we decided to order cluck clucks for delivery. This was my first time trying cluck clucks after several recommendations and my expectations were exceeded by far. From the super crispy , I mean CRISPY, chicken that keeps on giving to the perfect blend of soft and sweet to spicy jalape\u00f1o kicks in the waffle - cluck clucks has quickly become one of my favourites. My husband went for the Nashville hot chicken sandwich and I went for the mother clucker, so we could try a little of both. I'm that person who puts maple syrup all over her chicken and waffles, and cluck clucks makes the best version to have it just like that. The Nashville hot chicken means business though, you're warned! Even as someone who can handle her chilli pretty well, I was reaching for more sips of my drink! Oh and the fries. Wow. The fries. That chipotle sauce with crispy potatoey goodness... I need to get myself there again!","Sentiment":"positive"}

Same with the chicken. It was breaded lightly but in the sandwich it felt quite mushy. The chicken breast itself was fine, it was moist and the entire sandwich had good flavour. All in all, this could of been really good if the chicken and waffle itself gave a crunch or had a crispy edge to it. What happens with the sauce is that you end up eating someting a bit too soft and mushy.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The waffle was an afterthought. My favourite was the wings. They are whole wings and come in 4pc or 8pc. I ordered saucy and chose cluck sauce without knowing what it is. After tasting it I would describe as sweet and spicy and creamy and tangy. It was delicious and would order again.","Sentiment":"positive"}

If you have read my other reviews, I don't usually give less than , and that's exactly what happened here. To start our night we ordered drinks. We had the Raspberry Mojito and a chef special drink, which took 45mins because I guess it was \"too special\". We asked the server why our drink was late, explaining how late it was. The Server replied, \"I'm sure it's not been 45mins\" and then asked what was our drink. She could have just said \"sorry I forgot\" We got an appetizer which was a salmon dish. A complementary dish. I knew right away that our food was coming late because restaurants don't usually give out dishes \"free\" to keep our stomach full. At 10:57pm we were still waiting for our food. We asked for bread because we were really hungry. We got to the restaurant at 9:30pm. We were made aware that 10:45pm is the last order for the kitchen and then starts winding down at 11pm. And we were here waiting at 10:. I went to the manager to explain the situation. He goes to the kitchen and came to our table to let us know that the kitchen was a \"little\" backed up but our food is coming in 5min, which it did. All of us got our food except one person because there was an accident with the dish. Manager said sorry and was embarrassed etc etc. He gave us , as well as the dish they had messed up. But to be honest the dessert was the best part. I would let you guys decide if they were right to charge us 173$ gratuity after all the mess ups. I have attached the bill as proof. I would not come back here because of the service. Especially the server being sneaky with excuses. They had the audacity to let us know that gratuity is added. This is sad to see for a restaurant of this caliber after the service they provided us.","Sentiment":"negative"}

The steak was cooked perfectly, well seasoned and seared. Garlic mashed potato was creamy and yum, loved the cheese crust on the top. Wagyu meatball pasta was great. Dark chocolate mousse was delicious too. They also offered complementary bread and artichoke appetizer. The reason I gave it , was because I was expecting more with that price. For example, it was a birthday celebration and I had indicated that a cake would be lovely, but unlike their sister restaurant Butcher Chef, there was no cake served and we had to order one by ourselves.

Both were good, but not out of this world. The main course choices were: Half Chicken, Prime Beef Tenderloin, Eggplant Steak (Vegan option) and Lobster Gnocchi. We actually tried all the dishes. There were four of us at the table. Each plate was distinct and had its distinct flavors. I had the half chicken and it was crispy and juicy with each bite. My friend commented that the beef option and lobster dish were also delicious. The eggplant was a little too much on the \"fried\" or \"side\" -- no one in our group cared too much for it.

{"Review Text":"What an experience dining at Michael's on Simcoe! My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try Michael's on Simcoe for a while, but it's always been slightly out of our budget. Through the deal we got at Travelzoo, we were able to have a five course dinner here to celebrate Valentine's Day (not on the exact day of course). We were seated at the main dining hall, right in front of the fire place. The place felt upscale, yet inviting and not intimidating at all. We were also seated across from the mouthwatering dry-aged meats cooler that showed beautifully marbled steaks. Every single dish at Michael's was fantastic. The deep fried artichoke was light despite being deep fried. The beef carpaccio was melt-in-your mouth delicious. I had my reservations about eating raw meat but it was a fantastic dish. Then came the Carmela Di Fungi. I was a little worried that the pasta dish that came before the entree would be too filling and I wouldn't be able to enjoy the main course. I was wrong, the freshly made pasta dish was honestly my favorite part of the meal. It was so good, I vowed to never have dried pasta ever again if I could help it. It was creamy yet light and full of flavor. The steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it, though I think I would've preferred a less lean cut (more marbled would have been better). Dining at Michael's on Simcoe May have inadvertently bumped up my price bracket and now I'm hooked. Serves me right for dining at a place that was out of my means!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"An old school steak house underneath the Park Hyatt Hotel, Morton's delivered on their food. We ordered a filet mignon with a lobster tail, an aged steak, and a few sides and apps to share. Would highly recommend their bacon wrapped scallops but wouldn't get the fries again (not super exciting or fit well with the meal). They had a few cocktails and an extensive list of wines. We really enjoyed their old fashion but it was on the sweeter side. Service at the beginning was very attentive, sometimes even too much but as the night got busier it slowed down. We did have to wait for the bill a bit but that's around when the place was at its busiest. Since we went for a belated birthday, they brought us a little lava cake with a candle which was a nice touch. The decor is traditional and fits well for a steakhouse. Would definitely recommend this place for a special occasion if you're feeling like fancy steak or seafood.","Sentiment":"positive"}

We ordered the lobster ravioli because we were told there were , but we received the lobster mac and cheese instead. It was pretty good, so we just accepted it. The burrata salad was ok. The dressing was too tangy and something in it put me off. We got the grand ocean platter from the raw bar which was enough for all of us to finish. I really liked the ahi tuna poke. We got some sauteed brussels sprouts which I thought was mediocre at best. I've had amazing brussels sprouts elsewhere. The matchstick fries were really good, and I liked that it was a lot of them. Our friend recommended the Lyonnaise potatoes and that was one of the things I enjoyed a lot. For the meat we ordered the wagyu filet and prime NY strip, nothing really out of the ordinary. For a steakhouse, the selection felt meh to me. The wagyu was good, and the strip tasted like any other steak to me. I enjoyed my time with my friends, but the food and dining experience wasn't anything spectacular. I wouldn't dine here again.

Service was exceptional and really great can't complain! Our waiter was super friendly and quick he got our drinks and all our food requests in quick and met all our needs. Cons: Food: Below good:\/ my Caesar salad was awfully over dressed it was more of a soup than a salad lol and the romaine was wilted. My fries was brought out a year later loool ok no it was brought out after we were already being served our cakes and we had already ate our main course. Fries were cold and stale no surprise maybe they forgot to bring it out. ? My fish was bland but cooked perfectly just absolutely no flavour. I tried my husband's \"filet minion\" and unfortunately, It felt like it was a New york strip cut (cheaper cut) in a baseball shape to mimic a filet minion .. i think they tried to cheat a carnivore who they thought knew nothing about steak LOL .. can't fool me it looked dry and tasted super bland!

Th\u00e9 Cesar salad was rushed and looked like it was thrown on the plate. The Romain salad looked like it was starting to wilt and they drenched it in dressing with no flavors. I have to say they were generous with the Parmesan shaving . Th\u00e9 iceberg lettuce wedge should be a classic. Classics mistake this night. The iceberg was fresh but the dressing was missing the blue cheese punch. A little bit of blue cheese crumble with some egg and a few bacon pieces for decoration. Main course Th\u00e9 filet mignon was a nice piece and cooked well and was tender. How ever they did not season the  fillet mignon and was bland. I had to salt and pepper my steak . The sea bass was cooked perfectly but again the chef did not season it. No flavors at all had to add salt and pepper to it as well. The French fries They came out in a nice portion size however they were not cooked all the way and were still cold in the middle.

There were families with children, groups of friends, and couples. There was definitely  a holiday buzz in the atmosphere. After ordering an appetizer and a main from the menu, we started a round at the seafood bar. Fresh oysters, shrimp, crab legs, and mussels were displayed on ice. A server was present to serve your order with sauces of your choosing. This was the most civilized buffet I've ever seen. You were reminded you could return multiple times but the idea was to take enough and not be overly greedy or wasteful. For my appetizer, I had the tuna tartare. I thought it was amazing. My main was a braised short rib (if I remember correctly) and mushrooms on toasted sourdough. Again, delicious. Let's not forget there was a waffle station (with a dedicated server) and plenty of fresh fruits. I didn't think I could eat an entire waffle so I asked for a quarter. It was so light and fluffy! Drizzle some raspberry coulis or maple syrup on top? How about a nice plop of whipped cream? Choose your own adventure! To end off our meal, the dessert table was set up on one end of the bar. There was a nice variety of sweets to satisfy any sweet tooth. Cake logs, tarts, baked goods, etc. Beautiful presentation with a server to assist. It was a bit of a splurge at $.

House bread - So delicious and came with salted butter Oysters - Came in a half dozen, paired with the usual accompaniments including lemon, cocktail sauce, mignonette, and horseradish. They were fresh and not fishy at all Striploin - This was absolutely divine and cooked to a perfect medium rare. Served with mushrooms that were so delicious I couldn't decide whether I enjoyed the steak more or the mushrooms! Lobster - Sadly it was the tiniest piece of lobster and they served the claw (and not the tail)! Not much lobster meat at all so I would not recommend this dish. The accompanying jasmine rice was also very hard and overcooked Caramel dessert - A pleasant surprise, it tasted like ferrero rocher and included a little show (the waiter pours chocolate sauce all over the plate) Chocolate whiskey dessert - The chocolates themselves were nothing outstanding but the most memorable part was the brownie and whiskey ice cream Ambience was great and service was attentive.

{"Review Text":"Came here for a work dinner on a Tuesday night of the recommendation from a coworker. Restaurant was situated inside the four seasons hotel and was decorated immaculately. Our service was prompt but that wasn't difficult given there weren't that many tables. The bread came out nice and hot; perfect way to kick off the dinner. We shared a hamachi and a burrata. Both came out perfect. The hamachi was nice and light with a drop of citrus finish. The burrata and the jamon were a perfect combo. The saltiness from the jamon cut directly through the richness of the burrata. The entrees we got were the lobster, the lamb rack, and the beef duo. All the protein were cooked immaculately and flavor was good. The beef jus really helped elevate the dish but was a little odd with the eggplant pur\u00e9e. Might need a better delivery mechanism. Overall we had a really good meal but the portion size were a bit small for the price. I guess given the hotel and the name of Cafe Boulud it can always command customers.

The weekend brunch is a set menu with either two or three courses, for $ $. The newly refreshed brunch menu offers French classics with a contemporary twist such as Croque Madame, Eggs Benedict and Crepes. The oeufs en meurette (eggs in red wine sauce) are delightful. Two poached eggs sit on top of miche and tender short rib add a flavourful punch. The succulent red wine sauce ties the whole dish together. Service is impeccable and the ambiance is lovely for a meal any time of the day!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I'm so glad they removed all that artwork by Mr. brainwash. Everything is so much better now, although it's very mild and not memorable. I would rather recommend a restaurant for the food and great attentive service which we always receive than for the artwork being memorable but definitely it's a huge drag when they are at work, takes away from your pleasure with the food and the drink and the service.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"My friend and I read great reviews of this place, so we were very excited to experience everything it has to offer! Our visit was on a Thursday evening around 6:.m.- my friend made a reservation in advance and I'm glad that he did! It was a very busy evening, and the place was full. Our waiter was a young man who showed us our seat and explained briefly about the menu. Then he brought out water and left, so that we could look over the menu. The price is steep here- the appetizers start at , the mains start at , and the desserts start at . However, the quality of the ingredients and creative presentation of dishes make up for the price! For the appetizer, my friend ordered Squash\/Apple (soup) and I ordered Lobster\/Bagna Cauda (pasta). For the main dish, my friend ordered Gigu\u00e8re chicken\/Truffle (stuffed chicken with vegetables) and I ordered Scallop\/Squash. For drinks, we ordered the same one- non-alcoholic fruity drink. The drink was lightly sweet and delicious, it tasted like a sparking fruity drink. The appetizer, Lobster\/Bagna Cauda, was delicious! The pasta was cooked just right and the right amount of chew. The lobster pieces were juicy and succulent. The main dish, Scallop\/Squash, was also great- the portion size was small, but every bite was great! The scallop pieces were also juicy and succulent, and the squash was soft and warm. My friend also said his dishes were yummy! For dessert, we shared a Pear\/Mascarpone (mulled wine poached pear with honey mousse, ice cream, and caramel sauce). I never had a poached pear before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. To my surprise, it was very yummy- there were so many different flavours in my mouth! The tangy flavour of the poached pear balanced out well with sweet mousse, ice cream and caramel sauce. Throughout the evening, our waiter and other staff came by to check on us, making sure that the water was filled, empty dishes were taken away, and to check that we had everything that we needed. This would be a great place to celebrate a special occasion, a date night, or an indulgent treat for yourself and for your friend(s)! From start to finish, everything was top-notch! We had a great time and felt like royalty for the evening! Highly recommended!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Even we were sharply on time we had been told to wait as two groups of guests were in front of us. However there were many unoccupied tables in n the restaurant meanwhile! We waited for our mains about 30-!!! It is good we ordered fries to nibble on. My main Rossini due, goose liver was Extremely Salty but veal fillet is zero seasoned and tasted simply boiled nod grilled. My husband sweet bread was good but on a smaller size. Ambience is the only thing wort coming to this restaurant but I am not sure it worth the trouble. Olga L.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I've always wanted to try Cafe Boulud and I can finally say that I did and I love it. We were immediately brought to our seat by the server attendants (Raymond, Dhalwal and Marianna). Our server came to our table immediately. However, he did not introduce himself, ask how we were doing nor did he mention any specials; he only asked for our drink orders. Informed him that we will be needing a moment to review the menu as he came when the attendants were handing us the menu. He did not mention anything else and left. We were left puzzled and concerned by interaction. We later got his name (Shea) but the indifference towards us didn't diffuse. Each course arrived in a timely manner which Dhalwal and Raymond throughly explained each component of the dishes. As each dish was served, cutlery was discreetly switched out. After the main course, Shea returned with dessert menus. After placing our order, the cheeseboard and cake left, he returned to us with an \"Happy Anniversary\" dessert amenity, acknowledging this special event for this first time this evening. We had to ask what types of cheeses and croustini were on the board since it wasn't listed on the menu and he didn't present it to us like the other attendants. Overall, I loved it here with the food and quaint rustic design that Cafe Boulud brought to the table!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Made an OpenTable reservation at the last minute and was so pleased we did! The service was excellent, and the food was, too. The calamari and gnudi were a good pairing; since gnudi on its own is quite heavy, I recommend it alongside calamari for some crunch. The lasagna pinwheels were terrific as well, and a generous portion.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Went here on a Friday night as my second choice and I'm glad the first place I went turned me away because this place is a gem. They were happy to accommodate one for dinner during a Friday night rush and the service was impeccable and friendly. They made me feel at home. I started with a La Fumosa which was great but a tad sweet for my taste as I like my cocktails to be so balanced as to hold a house of cards. Second outing was a Speziato and it was perfect, house of cards in tact. I had no appetizers went straight for entree. I ordered off of the specials lamb shank with asparagus, broccolini and fingerling potatoes. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is the best lamb I've ever had from a restaurant. It was perfect, prepared medium rare. It melted in my mouth like butter and was not greasy or fatty nor hard which I find the norm when I order lamb. The greens were also perfectly cooked and really the only thing I can complain about is that I could have used one more fingerling potato. The potatoes were perfect and had this crunchy stuff on top that enlightened the perfection of their cook. I had a recommended red wine with dinner that escapes me but it was a perfect recommendation so that clearly speaks to the bar tender's knowledge. Flavors and textures working perfectly to create a symphony in my mouth! For dessert I had the white chocolate tiramisu with a recommended amaretto but not the regular amaretto you think of when you think of amaretto. I do not remember the name of it but it was a warm, comfortable handshake with the tiramisu. Again kudos to the bartender for being so knowledgeable. Friday night and this place was slammed, understandably so, yet the noise felt comfortable and added to the overall warmth of the ambiance. They were accommodating, friendly, helpful and the food was amazing. I'd definitely recommend eating here. Go hungry and eat a lot, you'll thank me for it. Hell, you'll thank them.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Everything here was an absolute chef's kiss! I'm still dreaming of their food to this day. For appetizers, we got the Insalata Con Burrata and the Calamari and both were fantastic. The burrata was to die for and the only complain was that we needed more! The calamari was crispy yet light, not too heavy handed on the batter. For my main, we got a couple of dishes to share: 1) Gnudi Al Funghi: this was my first time having gnudi and it was so pillowy soft and the wild mushroom sauce was amazing. 2) Linguine all'Aragosta: this was also so good! Worth the heavy price tag because of the lobster. 3) Pizza Dela Casa: definitely a unique combination that I haven't tasted before. Upon the first bite, you taste the honey coat your tongue and then it gets salty once you get to the burrata. Very delightfully interesting. 4) Pizza Con Salsiccia: didn't actually try this cause I was so stuffed by the end, but my family says this is better than the pizza dela casa and packs more of a punch. Even cocktails and desserts were amazing. I got the El Paradiso for my drink of the night, and that was strong - definitely not a watered-down cocktail at all. The Panna cotta for dessert was also creamy and smooth. Shoutout to the workers here cause the service was on point! Gave awesome recommendations, food came out timely and they even helped us take a great family pic. This is now my fave Italian place and I can't wait to come back.","Sentiment":"positive"}

There is very minimal seating outside, no patio. Drinks were $, would order again. I also had the Gnudi ConFunghi and it was divine. It was like eating soft, warm pillows. The mushroom sauce was great and I'd highly recommend. I'd definitely come back and try their pizza next time.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Let me start off by saying - just go here, try it. Phenomenal fresh Italian food that you CANNOT miss out on. So with that being said, of course this restaurant gets a 5\/5. Service excellent. Drinks phenomenal. Food exquisite. I would definitely come back. Came here on a evening dinner w my girlfriends, reserved thru open table. Better to rsvp ahead of time because it looked packed for walk-ins. Minus well save the stress and lock in a table. Drinks- many specialty cocktails that are flavourful. I opted for a lycee martini and it was light, flavourful and just the right amount of sweet. My friend got a strawberry speciality cocktail and it was also fantastic, great balance of flavourful juices, not too overpowering alcohol taste & great presentation. Food- for appetizers the girls had split : - grilled octopus - which is one whole grilled octopus tentacle with side crispy country style potatoes to compliment the tentacle. A tomato based sauce to also dip the potato and tentacle -- yummy! - cozze Al Bianco (mussels w a white wine sauce) ; amazing. Generous portion to share and service with side focaccia bread. - burrata - fresh fresh burrata, complimented by an arugula cherry tomato salad ; serviced with light garlic topped ciabatta ... man I mean what's not to love. Burrata is so hard to pass up. For entrees: - I ordered Gnudi con Funghi - and oh my goSh. LOL wow just order this because if you like mushrooms , truffle cream sauce and fresh ricotta gnudi pasta - your tastebuds will very much thank u for this experience. - my friends had ordered the seafood linguine, lamb chops, and another dish (I forgot) For desserts: - tiramisu - creamy,  balance of coffee, and white chocolate, and layered to a perfection. - panna cotta - drizzled with a caramel drizzle with a hint of vanilla bean - mild taste, smooth texture and fresh! - budino - wow! A recommendation from our server, his favourite dessert. And recommendation it was!! A rum bread pudding that was savoury sweet, warm, white chocolate ganache with side vanilla gelato-! Wow. If I were to choose- I would opt for budino! Service - I would like to give compliments to our server for being so accommodating, friendly and informative about menu selections. He was able to recommend favourites, attentive to table allergies and was able to check up on the group in a timely manner. I do take service into high consideration while giving out ratings; and he was a very personable; approachable, patient, attentive server! Made the experience a 5\/. HIGHLY** would recommend this place to eat. Bring good friends or family. Have a great time. Reserve ahead of time so you don't miss out!! Love love loved this place. Will see me again in the future.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Although our initial plan was to dine at Sugo, we found ourselves at the neighbouring restaurant due to the bustling crowd at Sugo Bar. Little did we know, this unplanned detour turned out to be a delightful pizza adventure. The oven-baked pizza was the star of the impromptu evening. Despite having to resort to lactaid for the cheesy indulgence, each slice was a treat for the taste buds. The crust had that perfect balance of chewiness and crispiness, while the toppings were a harmonious blend of flavors that left us craving more. The ambiance of the place was vibrant and lively, reflecting the constant buzz of patrons. It was clear that the popularity of the establishment was well-deserved, given the energetic atmosphere and the continuous flow of customers. While the pace added to the lively atmosphere, it also made it a bit challenging to secure a spot promptly.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"A few tips before my review: They only seat full parties. They also only accept debit cards or cash (no credit cards). And they don't take reservations so show up for an earlier dinner as the line gets really long later in the night. The host and servers are very friendly. We got the eggplant parm and rigatoni special which had a ros\u00e9 smoked bacon sauce. The rigatoni was delicious and everyone seemed to love it. The eggplant parm was also really good but could've used a little extra sauce. The slices of eggplant are very thin and fried to a crisp, which was nice but ended up being dry in the middle. I would definitely go back to try more dishes and their tiramisu, which I had no room for. The portions are pretty big. The place is also a little loud and popping, which was nice but you have to speak up.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"What I love about Sugo: large portions, tasty, affordability and overall vibe. It is SO FUN dining here. The food is good, a bit on the salty side but I don't mind it. My husband and I eat a lot, and we love leftovers, so for the price and quality Sugo works well for us. It's not fine dining so don't expect the best of best quality. It's comfort Italian - NY style without the NY accents. Also, I love their tiramisu, and their burrata bruschetta - YUM! If it wasn't for the long waits, we'd go more often!","Sentiment":"positive"}

Vodka rigatoni 10\/10 - Can never go wrong with this dish, tomatoey, saucey and so delicious. Portions are large here so it's great to share. Pesto with burrata 1000\/10 - This is their rotating flavour and I've been trying to catch this every time. Finally got lucky to try it! Creamy delicious burrata and decadent pesto sauce that was so vibrant green and beautiful to the eyes! Must get this again! Tiramisu 10\/. It's a large portion (as is everything else here). Always catch myself thinking of Sugo and wanting more pasta!!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"People always speak very highly of Sugo as budget-friendly and well-made Italian food. I dropped by with a group of . They do NOT do reservations so I recommend coming earlier if you have a larger party. There is also a bar with the same namesake right next door, but we were at the main restaurant (on the rightside). FOOD (3.5\/5) We ordered dishes family-style (to be shared) and got Calamari, Gnocchi, Rose Rigatoni, and a Chicken Parm. The calamari was super crispy, fresh and is served with battered spicy peppers and dipping sauces. Really solid starter for the table and was my favourite dish of the evening. The Gnocchi was topped with some whipped ricotta and basil which added a bit of levity to the otherwise slightly heavy dish. The gnocchi was plump, soft and had good mouth-feel that doesn't get tiring to eat. Good dish, but nothing special in my opinion. The Chicken Parm comes with two cutlets of chicken and heaping amount of marinara and mozzarella. Good dish to share as a protein addition for the meal. The Rose Rigatoni was a good break from the marinara sauce since it started getting repetitive and boring to eat. Flavour was a good balance of tartness and creaminess. This is a controversial take, but overall, I think the food is good quality and tasty but lacks in depth and texture. Most dishes was just TOO MUCH tomato sauce with no protein, acid, or creme fraiche to balance it out. Sad to admit, but when the rose rigatoni came I had a mini \"thank goodness\" to give my mouth a break from all the marinara. SERVICE (5\/5) The staff was really kind, patient and accommodating for our group. Even though more patrons came in to add to the waitlist, we never felt rushed to eat and get out hastily. AMBIENCE (4.5\/5) The restaurant really emanates a cozy mom-and-pop diner and when it gets busier the chatter helps add to the vibe. On a nice sunny day, there's plenty of natural light that makes it inside. ACCESSIBILITY (4\/5) Sugo is located directly on Bloor right outside Landsdowne station so it is super easy to get to by transit and locate. I'd say with any downtown spot, if you were going to drive, street parking will be your best option around the neighbourhood. PRICE (3\/5) I think the price is alright, although I would expect some light protein in the pastas for the price. They also only take cash or debit - so be prepared! OVERALL (3\/5) I can understand why people rave about Sugo for good Italian food, but maybe the super high expectations let me down a bit. The highlights for me were the service and the calamari. I must say, the food is good quality and the vibes are really casual and wholesome but I personally would not wait more than 15-. Might be back!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Uncomfortable Dining Experience - Not Recommended My recent visit to Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ (North York) with eight colleagues turned out to be an incredibly uncomfortable and disappointing experience. We opted for the 'Ultimate Course' as recommended by the menu, which allowed us to choose from a wide variety of dishes, promising an enjoyable meal for our group. While the meat dishes were enjoyable, our enthusiasm was marred by the ordeal we faced concerning leftover side dishes. Despite ordering the suggested menu for our group size, we ended up with a small amount of uneaten sides. To our shock, the waiter informed us that we would be charged extra for each piece of leftover food. We didn't like how the restaurant charged extra for any leftovers, so we decided to eat all of the leftovers. While we were eating what was left on our plates, the waiter kept circling around our table to keep an eye on us. The situation escalated when the staff, donning plastic gloves, meticulously inspected the remaining food in front of us. This intrusive and uncomfortable act felt like an invasion of privacy, leaving us feeling constantly watched and pressured to eat every last bite, even if the food didn't meet our satisfaction. Adding to our dismay, the knowledge that a compulsory 18% tip was required for groups exceeding six guests was not disclosed upfront. This, coupled with the uncomfortable scrutiny throughout the meal, only added to our dissatisfaction. Our attempt to address our discomfort with the manager was met with indifference. Despite conveying our feelings about the invasive inspection and uncomfortable atmosphere, the manager dismissed our concerns, citing restaurant regulations. This experience left a sour taste, and regrettably, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone. The lack of consideration for customers' comfort and the way the situation was handled by the staff and management were disappointing. I would strongly advise against visiting this place.","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Gyu-Kaku has been on my list to try for awhile now and finally trying it out was an exciting experience. I came around 4pm with a few friends so there was plenty of seating to choose from and happened to be the Happy Hour time. There was an extensive menu from BBQ, rice dishes, ramen and more, which is perfect for people with different food tastes! I mostly stuck with JBBQ items from what I've tried. The service for the BBQ was really quick and the staff were attentive. I got a mix of beef, pork and seafood that all came in good quality at reasonable price point. Also note that this place is an a-la-carte BBQ place. 100% worth visiting this JBBQ place if you're craving some delicious food at reasonable prices! Especially since Gyu-Kaku always has specials, it's definitely worth checking out the menu beforehand. If you're looking for a social spot to eat, this spot is perfect for both small and large groups.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Hard to believe with gyu-kaku being in the GTA with multiple locations that only recently I've tried it. Always interesting to see how these bbq chains compare to one another since their offerings are identical (though shinta and gyubee are AYCE). Went with  (which serves , $49.95) since we were pretty hungry. Basically, . The lunch offerings that they have here are quite value imo. The set included a handful of starters (salad, miso soup, rice and chicken karaage) along with kalbi chuck rib, filet mignon, bistro hanger steak, garlic shrimp and a mushroom medley. Personally really liked the chuck rib and filet mignon, just packed with a ton of flavour and when dipped in their selection of yuzu\/soy sauces it's really good. Everything else was pretty standard. They also offer a bunch of daily specials on alcohol, with Tuesdays offering a pitcher of sapporo for only $12. Unfortunately went on a Wednesday and sake was not really of interest before heading back to work after. Service was also pretty excellent, as they guided us through the menu and how to best cook each of the meats on the grill. I'd definitely come back for lunch as the dinner menu seems a tad pricy.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I had the curry Katsu. It's not available everywhere so I was thrilled to find it here.  It's a fave.  Just the perfect amount of spicy and the right amount on the plate. Food is cooked fresh to order. Server was pleasant and responsive. Only one thing we did not enjoy was the very loud pop music.  But the food was great. Check them out.  You won't be disappointed.

{"Review Text":"Since COVID19 happened, I've been trying new restaurants and have been in a fried food phase. One random day, I was craving Tonkatsu and did some Yelping to find great reviews for this spot. I debated on trying other spots because some are more famous than this, but I adored this meal. Perhaps because this was a delivery order, the takeout container gave me a mom and pop-vibe type of meal, and I was all for it. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin Katsu with curry and enjoyed every single bite. I really wanted to spread this into two meals so I used all my willpower to save some of the curry sauce for another day. The katsu was crispy, not dry, and not too thin of a piece of meat. I would 100% come here again and order the same meal (or two orders of it).","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I will never underestimate the simplicity of katsu. After my experience at Mr. Tonkatsu, I will never turn my eye away from a perfectly cooked pork katsu. I came to Mr. Tonkatsu a few weeks looking for a nice quick meal before my hockey game. It was relatively quiet for a Wednesday evening (probably due to the snow) and it was nice to be seated and served immediately. There were plenty of options on the menu from the traditional katsu setup, donburi, curry, many delicious options to select. I decided to go with the Pork Katsu with Curry on Rice. My goodness was the one of the best hearty dishes I had in a long time. The pork was fried to a great crisp, while maintaining nice moisture in the meat. The curry was full of flavour, with a nice combination of aroma and spiciness to compliment the rice. The shredded cabbage on the side serve as a nice palate cleanser and cool down if you have a low tolerance on spice. Overall, Mr. Tonkatsu has lived up to its billing for a great place for nice date night, pre or post game meal, or even just an awesome takeout option if you don't feel like cooking! I will be back soon to try their other options on the menu!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"One of my new favourite Korean BBQ places! Love that there are complementary side dishes on the grill - there's egg, kimchi, cheesy corn, and garlic. You can refill them too. The cheesy corn was my favourite, look at that cheese pull! On top of that there's various complementary small side dishes, soup, and a refillable basket of lettuce to wrap the meat. For the meat, we ordered Pork Jowl Meat, Pork Belly w\/ Skin, Beef Short Plate. All of the meat tasted amazing! I like that the meat was not pre-marinated, but instead they give you sauces to dip it in after it's cooked. They've got COVID-, hand sanitizer, and social distancing. You can also enjoy this Korean BBQ out on their beautiful patio, except there just might be some bees flying around...","Sentiment":"positive"}

I'm so glad the ambiance, quality of the food, and the service remained consistent since my last visit in May.","Sentiment":"positive"}

We ordered three meat orders, a spicy noodle salad side, and an pitcher of apple mojito soju mixed drink. The mixed drink was so delicious and dangerous at the same time which helps cut the fattiness of the meat. The spicy noodles really goes well with Korean barbecue. I also feel that the quality of the food here is better than the other location I tried. The servers are very friendly and very attentive to their customers, and the restaurant still had that Daldongnae vibe. I will definitely come back here for more delicious Korean barbecue.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"There was a request for Korean BBQ so we checked out this location. The outside is deceiving as it looks like a quiet house, but the moment you walk in, the space is bustling with patrons. They decorated the space with a bunch of antiques and  it makes you feel like you are sitting outside eating. For those who actually want to sit outside, there is a patio space in the back. You are required to order a grill dish for each person at the table and each grill dish is around $25. That is before ordering rice or noodles so the bill quickly adds up. I enjoyed the refillable sides, including the steamed egg\/kimchi\/corn\/garlic which cooks at the rim of the grill. Would definitely recommend getting some rice to make lettuce wraps with!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"It was seamless to grab a seat midweek evening when I was there. Overall, a thumbs up. As a group of three, we ordered three portions of meat and the Kimchi fried rice, which was the ideal quantity of food for us. Quality delicious BBQ and it reflects in the price. I would've liked more sides to finish my meal, but if you've completed your meat, they stop refilling your banchan\/sides. So make sure you preorder your side refills before you finish cooking your meat. Pros: Quality meats, light sauces that compliment the meats well without overpowering, and the sides like cheesy corn, steamed egg and of lettuce to wrap the meat. Love pork belly and you can have it cut thick or thin. The Kimchi fried rice is amazing! Better than what I can make at home. Cons: They only have red meat - ie. different cuts of pork and beef, no chicken and no seafood. However, for vegetarians, they do have a veggie  grilling portion. They don't have complimentary Korean green onion salad, which I had in my fav KBBQ restaurant. I love to eat it with grilled meats. Though that one is closed since the pandemic... and not sure if it's something other KBBQ restaurants offer nowadays.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"There's a reason Daldongnae's are popping up all over the city! This one is also located on Yonge in a busy stretch. It does amazingly have a small parking lot in the back. The decor is reminiscent of the other locations. It's dark on the inside with a lot of wood paneling like an old school bar. We went a later in the afternoon around 2pm and we were able to get seated immediately. They have booths that can accommodate a good number of people - we had a party of 8. Daldongnae is not all you can eat with the trade off being that their meats are high quality. You also have some great bonuses like the garlic and steamed egg that come with the grill. The banchans are refillable but there are limits on these.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Food is good. The BBQ pan is kinda dangerous in a way, but no server was trying to remind us. One of our friends got severe burns from the corn popping out from the pan because of the heat. They didn't have a cool bag. They didn't show the care. We have to finish our meal earlier to do first aid at home.","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Ordered pork belly, beef short ribs and beef short plate, not like last time in Scarborough Daldongnae, this time I liked the short plate the most! Seafood pancake was crispy but can't spot too much seafood , a lot of green onions The service was good and fast , and their backyard patio is open, nice vibes , great for meat lovers like me :)","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Got pork belly with skin & pork shoulder butt at this Korean BBQ place. The meats were decent. The decor is cute, like you're sitting at a Korean night market. Pork Kimchi stew was decent. It was sour & spicy (I don't like kimchi). It was also pretty sweet: more sweet than other kimchi stews. It was generous with ingredients. There were  & kimchi in the hot plate. So effectively there were 7. There was egg & garlic too; the egg after a while became like steamed egg Complimentary soy bean soup was good: mainly salty notes with some spicy ones. It was like spicy miso. The rice served here was not white but red rice.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Daldongnae's another one of my favourite places to go for kbbq! It was my first time going to this location. We ordered a few meats. It comes with a lot of sides, tofu stew, and some sauces for dipping. I really liked how our server explained what each side dish was. All the sides are refillable. We also ordered the Korean egg rolls. It was good but I probably wouldn't order it again as one of the sides is already steamed egg. My go to is usually the seafood pancake. There's also parking located behind the building which you can enter through the side street. The parking lot isn't the most obvious but the entrance is connected to the Katsuya parking lot!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"There's been so much hype about this place, especially on Tiktok, so my expectations were sky high but I would say Imanishi managed to meet them. As soon as you walk in, you know you're in for a good meal. The decor is cute and cozy izakaya vibes, and it feels like you're sitting down to a homestyle Japanese meal. The menu is fantastic, as they have a wide variety of small share plates that include some great creativity. There weren't any bad bites, I'd say every single bite I had was at the very least good. All the ingredients (especially the sashimi) were high quality and were very thoughtfully put together. A few of my favourite bites included the hamachi sashimi, beef tataki, curry spring rolls, and most of all the gyudon which felt like a warm, cozy hug in every bite. Their famous corn tempura dish was good but also the only dish that could have obvious improvement with some sauce. For dessert, you have to try the tokyo toast which was a sweet deep fried toast topped with ice cream. Overall, this was a great meal from start to finish which was capped off by some great service. I'd definitely come back here.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Reserved a spot and came here on a Tuesday night. The vibe of the restaurant would be perfect for a date night, with candle lights on each table. My top 3: Eggplant, Curry (it was a tie between curry and tai carpaccio), and Tokyo Toast Sashimi ($) It came with Hamachi, Scallop, and Snapper. The pieces were tasty and fresh. It felt a bit expensive, but they were good. Cold Served Agedashi Eggplant ($9) I love eggplant, so I made sure to order this. My friend who wasn't too keen on ordering this said it was the highlight of the dinner. lol It was well soaked in dashi broth, well cooked, and tasted quite delicate but very tasty. Gailan Gomaae ($9) I liked how cooked the gailan was (not overly cooked with a nice crunch), but it tasted a bit too vinegar-y for a gomaae. I'm pretty sure it's because of the dressing they use, but I would probably not order it again. Beef Tataki  ($21) The beef seemed a bit too cooked, and the fried chickpea added for a nice presentation, but was very dry and crusty for it to go with the dish personally. Tai Carpaccio ($19) This went REALLY well with the vinaigrette and salsa. I liked it much more than the tataki. Anchovy Potato Salad & Chips ($10) Great price. The anchovy taste was quite faint, and I found the potato chunks to be too big. I liked the idea of adding the taro chips, but I would want a potato salad that's a bit more flavorful and perhaps creamy. Corn Kakiage ($9) It was good. I love corn and I love kakiage in general, so seeing the reviews, I was definitely overly hyped about it. But it tasted like it looks. I do wish there was a bit more corn. Tebasaki ($15) Great value and pretty solid taste. The meat was quite juicy as well. Saba Miso-ni ($13) I was surprised by how much I got for $13. It was also very well cooked and the sauce was great. Karashi Ribs ($16) The meat was tender, juicy, and fell off the bone with ease. While, I thought this would be my highlight, the karashi mustard overpowered the dish a bit. Pork Belly Miso Katsu ($16) It was good. I personally liked it more than the tebasaki, but it might be because I am very used to the taste of the tebasaki since I've made similar ones at home. Gyudon ($15) It was good but nothing special. The price was good but felt more expensive than the other dishes we ordered. Imanishi Beef Curry ($15) Great fruity Japanese curry gravy. I loved it. I just wish they put more beef chunks as it was hard to find the chunks. Tokyo Toast ($9) This was definitely one of my favorite. I did not expect it to be that good. The toast was a bit crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside, with a nice combination of icecream and the texture and taste of toasted soba. I found this place to be a very affordable place for the quality of food you get as well. I'm also glad that they were transparent about how many pieces comes with each dish. And how the server was telling us it might be too much food for us when we initially ordered, and explored food menu options that might be better for the first round of ordering. They were also very prompt in changing the dirty plates for us as well.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Highly recommend a this sexy yet cozy Japanese restaurant. Great vibe and crowd. Perfect for date night or dinner w friends. We tried several dishes and must say everything was delicious. Cilantro Shrimp Salad was so fresh. The pork ribs fell off the bone. Monkfish pate was so rich. And the Tokyo toast was to die for. Definitely come here. I reserved through the Resy app.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This is a tapas-style Japanese restaurant on Dundas West with great food and a cozy, laid back vibe. You basically have no choice but to make a reso, so be sure to do so online before you visit or you'll be waiting hours for a table. I had the Kuchibeni drink; while it's a pretty small cocktail, the flavour is really nice and sweet. We had a number of apps - the corn, eggplant, pickles, sashimi, and tofu salad. My favourites were the corn and tofu; the corn was a nice crunchy snack and the tofu salad was fresh and light. I'd suggest only trying the eggplant if you're with a group of 3+, for only 's quite a lot. My friend and I ended up leaving half the dish untouched. For my entree, I tried the Gyudon. I think it's pretty similar to other dons I've had - their apps are so inventive that this in comparison is quite regular. Lastly, I tried the Tokyo Toast and it was my favourite dish of the night. The toast is perfectly sweet, the toasted soba adds a nice crunch, and the ube ice cream is a great pairing to top it off. 10\/!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Food was mediocre. 3\/5. - The best dish was the ribs -- the meat was super soft but the sauce felt very American -- too sweet and thick for my liking. - The fried corn was unique and tasty. - The grilled mackerel was mediocre. I would have preferred a grilled cod but they don't offer it. - The sashimi special is said to have  (bluefin tuna, scallop, hamachi), but the portions of each piece were so small it is almost like they took a piece of sashimi and cut it into three pieces. Definitely not worth it. I think Kinka's sashimi and food is way better quality and taste and flavor than Imanishi. - dessert: they only had one dessert option which was ice cream on Japanese toast. It was enjoyable to eat. Service: 2\/5 - the server asked us multiple times if we wanted drinks -- so they do pressure you in a way to order alcohol. - we went on a Friday night so our waiter was always busy and it took a while to get his attention. (Note: inattentive) - in the end, even though we finished our food but didn't ask for the bill yet, the waiter gave us our bill already. That is quite rude and we saw them do the same to the table next to us as well.  I might expect this at a lower end restaurant or we sat for too long (we were there for only less than one hour). So unless you keep ordering alcohol I think you are just going to get the boot as soon as you finish eating. Not fine dining at all. Oh and this restaurant has the default tip percentage set at 20%. Ambiance: 4\/5 - good intimate date place if you are focused on getting a drink here. Food is just mediocre so don't expect too much. Overall: - come here for the drinks and ambiance only if you really want to. - if you want to go to a good Japanese izakaya restaurant then I will recommend Kinka izakaya - if you want a Japanese restaurant with sake and food-- then even Sakai Bar has better food (but service is just as bad imo). -","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I came to Imanishi on a Friday night at 9pm. Until 10pm, they only accommodate reservations so I had to wait an hour to be seated. During that time I went to another bar down the street. I came back at 10pm and was seated almost immediately. The seating was communal and my party of two shared a table with another party of two. No big deal. The restaurant had a cozy, casual vibe, with warm lighting and good music. By 10pm they were out of the sashimi, so we ordered the corn karage and beef tataki. Both were so delicious. I would recommend trying these dishes. I would come back again with a reservation so I could be seated earlier!","Sentiment":"positive"}

It was such a warm, intimate, and cozy vibe as soon as you walk in, and they had the best playlist - we even ended up Shazamming a song. We sat at the bar, which is always fun, and by the time we left, the place was packed behind us. Definitely book reservations in advance if you're with a larger group or want a table. There are tons of delicious shared plates on the menu, which obviously we tried, but my favourite was the black cod which was one of the specials for the night. All of the servers were friendly, attentive, and had great recommendations. Can't wait to come back again!","Sentiment":"positive"}

I can't really name each one but one of the curries had a tad too much ginger (possible because I just got a large piece) but while the tandoori and mutton were succulent without being over cooked, I was really surprised by the creaminess and the balance of the paneer. The star of the show was the Naan\/ roti. Not only are they so fluffy they are soooooo crispy! Without any oiliness as they were cooked via tandoor","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"They offer catering of individual thali \/ box meals with vegetarian and non-vegetarian options for large groups. Order arrived in a timely manner. The Matar Paneer was decent, but contained very few peas. The paneer itself was alright - tasted like firm tofu (which I liked) as opposed to the salty Western cheeses. The thali also came with Tri-Pepper Corn Chaat, Gobhi Aloo, Dal Tadka, a very small salad of lettuce and carrot, saffron rice, naan, veggie samosa, and Gulab Jamun (fried milk dumpling in saffron honey syrup). Other than the Gulab Jamun, almost everything was extremely spicy. The Gobhi Aloo wasn't that great, but the Dal Tadka (split lentils) was okay - it had a soupy consistency that went well over the rice. The naan was very tough. Samosa had pretty good seasoned potatoes filling, but the dough was too crumbly and flaky. Salad was just a small piece of lettuce with a few shreds of carrot.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"The food was delicious. The kids loved the butter chicken with zeera rice and garlic butter naan. We ordered the tadka daal too . It was good .

{"Review Text":"I came here after visiting the AGO since it was nearby and I thought I was about to find a hidden gem since it has really good reviews. Unfortunately, it didn't really meet my expectations. I tried the hotate wasabi & yuugi sushi as everyone keeps mentioning that these are the standout dishes. I thought they were okay. The scallop wasn't soft and had an almost rubbery texture. The sushi wasn't bad, the smoky flavour made it unique but in general I've had much better torched pressed salmon. They also have daily specials - I tried the grilled pork belly skewers and they were better but needed a bit more salt. Overall, I'd rate my experience here a 6\/10. The ambience was very nice and service was attentive. They also gave us sake shots on the house! I really wanted to like the food but it just didn't hit for me.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Yuugi is located downtown in Baldwin Village, with a casual vibe. The interior is minimalistic with white walls and wooden acccent. A small highlight, is that their washrooms have high tech toilets similar to those found in Japan.  The staff here were also all very friendly and attentive. This is a great spot to consider if you're downtown and looking for late eats, as they're open until , or if you're just craving some traditional Japanese bar food. The menu here is tapas style meant for sharing, and the \"sushi\" served here are also all lightly torched, which makes them a good start for those who wish to try sushi but are not ready for the fully raw stuff. What was ordered: - Yuugi Sushi - Saba Sushi - Wagyu Sushi - Chicken Wings - Saba Yakimeshi The wings were well seasoned and crispy, and I also liked the Yuugi Sushi.  The Wagyu Sushi was ok in my opinion. The flavouring was good, but the quality of the beef didn't meet my standards. I personally didn't like the saba dishes too much because I found them a bit fishy and salty. However, the other two individuals I was with really enjoyed them, so it really depends on your taste preferences.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Love trying new places and this definitely seemed promising as I love izakayas. We tried so many things on the menu. The standout for me was the torched salmon sushi. The other one we tried of course the wagyu roll but very disappointing- so dry and tasteless not all how beautiful this beef should be. Though the karaage is popular- I can't say it stood out for me.  However, the Udon Pepperoncino with chili cream sauce and bacon had more depth although back of the throat coughing action accompanying it The dessert options that were written didn't get me excited. However, the more detailed description sold me on the idea better but by that time - we were ready to go. The server I know was doing his job but he seemed rather short and impatient with us and we felt it. We still had a good time. I am happy to have tried this place. It's a nice modern spot. But for me, I needed something to pop out in the food and customer service is really important for me.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"If you're looking for some late night eats during the week, Yuugi is definitely a yummy spot to visit. Came here with friends after a comedy show and we left the place feeling full and satisfied :D Quick notes about Yuugi Late night - One of the very few places that opens past midnight in the Kensington\/Chinatown area :) Interior - Cozy and cute with a touch of Japanese decor. Not as dimly lit like a traditional izakaya but it's homey. Definitely a nice place to kick it with friends or bring a date. Menu: Yuugi offers a nice twist on traditional dishes. Highly encourage trying out most of the items since it was pretty good. Also, portion size here is a bit small, so best to order a few dishes to share. Food\/Drinks: Tried the following - Gyoza: Pretty crispy and tasty! I like the presentation in how the pieces were connected together. Ramen Poutine: Imagine ramen ingredients instead of cheese curds and gravy over a bed of fries. Sounds strange, looks a little odd but tastes so dang good!! Chicken Kaarage: Standard but the sauce was so yum Ebimayo: Really dig this dish. Mayo sauce was definitely the highlight as it complemented the shrimp very well. Tontoro: Pan-fried pork jowl turned out meatier than expected....really tasty and I do like the yummy crunch. Drinks: Pretty yummy across the board if you opt for a cocktail. Service: Friendly staff!

{"Review Text":"Yuugi Izakaya is one of the better izakayas in the city and is located in Baldwin Village. There is plenty of street parking (Green P) and the restaurant has a patio that is pet-friendly! I really enjoyed all the side dishes that our table ordered - my personal favourite was the Chicken Karaage, mainly because of their house-made tartare sauce. The sauce is mixed with an egg yolk and really adds a unique flavour to the chicken. I also enjoyed the Ebimayo, and wished there were more pieces in an order (there are 4). If you are looking to order their sushi, I would recommend the Salmon Sushi or Yuugi Sushi. I got the Wagyu Sushi as well, but for the price, I thought it was a little overrated. Overall, I would recommend this location to small to medium groups (2-) so that you have enough people to order several different items on the menu to share!

So I book ahead this time with my husband and friends to celebrate a low key birthday. They sat us right near the door, which is not really the best spot, but that's fine. We ordered a bunch of drinks and different foods to share family style. The service was soooooo slow. We waited so long for the food. One of my friend was pregnant and I felt so bad that she had to starve for that long. We told the server and he seemed a little annoyed that we asked. I understand it can be busy, but it's still fair to ask. Also, at the begining when we were placing our orders, we asked questions about the foods and drinks and he wasn't the friendliest. He even cut the conversation mid way and left to attend to another table while we were still talking to him. The entire experience with that server was so weird. Later, the manager came by and appologized for the wait and said to not worry, and that he will take care of us. I am not sure what he was trying to say by taking care of our table, but we all assumed that maybe he'll throw in some free dessert or drinks, or maybe give us a little discount. But nothing. And even after the manager came by, we still had to wait for our food. And let's talk about the food. The portions were pretty small, and taste wise, nothing memorable. The fried zucchini flowers was the biggest disappointment of all time. Needless to say, this was a big flop.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Our waiter was exceptional in offering his expertise on menu recommendations and appropriate wine pairings.  We dined on the patio and it made for a very pleasant experience.

{"Review Text":"Well, I can say I was very excited to check out this place especially with all of it's accolades  However, maybe this was one of those off days.  I went with eleven people spread over tables. So I can say, we were all surprised how things played out. As for myself, I just came back from Rome so I was missing some of my daily food.  In Rome, sourcing local and just how things are grown it's hard to ask for more fresh taking ingredients. I was, to say the least, not that thrilled by anything. Although I will say the pasta was quite nice and so was the in house bread. But the burrata was tough and dry.  I have been accustomed to a softness in the texture. You know, a good burrata you literally could just bite right into this. I didn't want much more than a few bites. I love cacio pepe but I was craving the amatriciana.  It was not bad but the guanciale was  over cooked and some pieces I can say were too crisp almost burnt and folks if you are familiar with the ones  in Rome it's not what you want. It had a heat to it sure but perhaps a little heavy handed . I enjoy spice but the burnt pork pieces was overwhelming The squid ink was unfortunately, much too bland. You can get away with less in Rome because every ingredients sings so well solo but the harmony here was off. Like I said, every great place has its off days. Both servers at the tables we thought maybe it was their first day? I read reviews where the servers come back to the check repeatedly to see how we were doing. Do you have any idea how hard it was for us to get our server back to our table? We had a large party so we were seated at two separate tables and the reviews for the customer service and food were the same. Although we heard great things about the fish and montalpucino wine. I did enjoy the house made bread as well as the al dente of their house made pasta.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The sushi was great and we really liked all three rolls. The Salmon Avocado rolls were packed with a lot more salmon and avocado than we'd get at most places so that was a very pleasant surprise. The Atlantic Queen roll and Spicy Salmon roll were both super flavourful as well. From the three tacos we tried the Shrimp was definitely our favourite. They were very well seasoned and the toppings complimented the flavour well. I was so excited for the Bulgogi taco, and although the beef was delicious there was way too much Queso Fresco that overwhelmed the taste. The fish tacos were pretty good but nothing too amazing. We hope to be back sometime, especially if they still have the 30% platters takeout deal.

The roll was plentiful and not too spicy, so perfect for me. The bulgogi taco has a ton of juicy bits of beef. It aAlso tastes great. My only criticism is the cheese in the bottom of the taco below the meat gave it a strange texture.   I think they should remove the cheese below the beef. Next time I'll try the chicken tinga taco. The crispy taco was also well made. A real fried tortilla shell, not a typical store bought taco shell as most Canadian places use . I'm from California so I know tacos.  I recommend Saku, or maybe should be spelled Sacu (sushi\/taco).","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Sushi and drinks in one place! Don't miss out on this modern, chill vibe Japanese restaurant! Thank you for the staff's recommendation! We tried all of their popular dishes and absolutely loved their bulgogi taco.  The beef filling was generous, and the sauce was a perfect match. We also enjoyed their rolls, which tasted fresh and delicious. Personally, I like the saku roll, which includes scallops, tuna, avocado, fish eggs, coriander, and jalapeno - it was mouthwatering! And let's not forget their Tokyo Rose cocktail, which is mixed with sake. It has a great fruity taste and is easy to drink.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Went on a busy Saturday night and still had great service. Food came out quickly and the portions were generous for two. The highlight was the salmon tataki, which was a nice contrast to the fried takoyaki. Also, the assorted tempura was much bigger than we expected! Our server gave us some great recommendations. We'll be back!","Sentiment":"positive"}

It has the same great food and lively atmosphere. It's a little less busy during late lunch hour, but there were a couple tables and service was still great. Appetizers are beautifully plated and yummy, the yuzu salsa was a really nice touch to seared sashimi. This time instead of tacos and rolls, I tried the sushi, sashimi and futomaki, which was good in variety and freshness, but missing the wow factor like my experience at The Haam. But definitely not to the chef's fault, cause they still have rolls and taco on the menu, and the Shrimp Taco packs a punch!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I just wanna say, my expectations were sort of low going to a restaurant where the main benefit is a beautiful view, but this fell below my expectations in every single way. You guys know if you've read my review before that I'm usually very kind about how I leave the reviews and I look at the bright side of every situation. But there just wasn't a bright side here besides the view. First of all... The food was trash, pure trash. Nothing that we had was even remotely good. I'll start off with the okay parts of the experience and move forward to what was really bad. The beef cheek was a new experience for us, we were fine with the texture and flavor of the meat but the demi glac\u00e9 sauce they used was kind of yucky, the vegetables were prepared well and cooked nicely. I would give it a . So . I did enjoy that they included chanterelle mushrooms though, been a while since I've had those. The lobster meat wasn't a lot for $'t bad. It's hard to mess up lobster . But at least they could have given us one lobster tail for the price rather than half a lobster, I don't like working hard to eat cracking things and poking around for meat. The fries were cooked well but they didn't have any proper dipping sauce for it and their ketchup tasted like Heinz, which is mind blowing that at a 't make their own ketchup from scratch or at least buy a more expensive gourmet bottle of ketchup to use. The mash potatoes were okay, nothing to write home about or complain about; just okay. The service and the lamb are a big reason why they didn't get , this is where things really went sideways. The lamb was brought to me rare and they tried to convince me that it was medium. Look at the picture I attached to Yelp, I don't need to be a chef to tell you that's not medium lol. Now here's where the service issues started. The server couldn't take the lamb off the bill even though it was clearly not cooked how we asked. So he made a sigh and got the supervisor who was pretending to be the manager at the time, and he looked at the lamb and said \"I hear there's an issue with the lamb, it looks medium rare to me, what's the problem?\", I replied that we ordered it medium, he didn't believe us and had the audacity to ask the server in front of us, the sever confirmed that we indeed did ask for it to be cooked medium. You would think at this point that he would stop giving up ripping us off and finally remove it from the bill right? Wrong. Now he said well you should have said something sooner so we could have re made the dish but now the kitchen is closed and we can't do anything for you. I said yeah you sure as heck can, you can take it off the bill. And he said \"sorry we can't do that because the dish was already made\". To which I replied \"yes but it was made wrong this is not what I ordered, hence nothing was made for me yet which means that yes you can, you should, and you will remove it\", the conversation kept going back and forth and getting more and more heated and I told him if he doesn't know customer service then to just leave because I was wasting my breath on him. I asked the sever if he had a manager to which he said yes and brought the lady in charge named  Solen or solet I believe. She apologized that we didn't like it but she was also trying to back up the previous person at first about not refunding but she was a little more flexible and a bit nicer and eventually after a few exchanges back and forth we were able to get at least the lamb item removed. All I gotta say is never again!","Sentiment":"positive"}

This is already with us cutting ahead of a lot of normal tourists etc because of the restaurant booking. Service was fine. Once we sat down nice waitress came by and explained what we needed to order. Kids went first. Kid 1: Caesar, salmon, sundae Kid 2: Caesar, steak, sundae Overall for 40$ it's great value considering the view. Steak and salmon could have been seasoned better but the quantity is there. My only complaint is no bread. Or 6$ per person to get sourdough bread. That's terrible. Not a dealbreaker but wtf. Adult 1: tuna, cabbage, fruit tart Adult 2: crab salad, beef cheeks, chocolate mousse Everything was good other than cabbage roll. I would say go for the view, experience and the food doesn't suck.

{"Review Text":"A+ for the decor, the concept, and the view. A+ on the presentation of the meal. C- on the service. F on the food. On balance, I don't recommend eating here when you can get the view on the observation deck just below without getting ripped off. Okay, the bread comes out right away, which is great. But when the best part of the meal is the bread, that isn't good. It was downhill from there. I started with an octopus salad then I got the steak (which was overcooked, I ordered it medium rare and it come out a strong medium).  I don't even remember what the dessert was, other than tasteless. Here's what really bugged me ... the service. It was actually annoying. They hawk over you. I could barely finish a thought during conservation where there wasn't someone jamming more wine into our glasses to get us to finish faster, or asking us multiple times if we were done when there was clearly still food on our plate. While superfically \"polite\" (it's , after all) because there were always the \"please\" and \"thank you\" qualifiers during all verbal interactions, they were also very annoying. \"Are you done? Of course sir, thank you, sir, thank you so much, ok sir\" .. like, not to let my Jersey-guy out, but  ... shut up and go away. You're a gnat. In short, the place is a rip off. I should have eaten at Boston Pizza. Both the whole in my stomach AND wallet would have been a lot smaller at least.","Sentiment":"positive"}

It was perfect as well and just the right amount of food. Also a great corner setting in the heart of Kensington.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I particularly enjoyed the Hariyali Chicken tikka - moist and flavorful. Their chicken Biryani comes dum style cooked with a 'purdah' curtain of dough trapping all the flavor within. Their stuffed kofta with garlic naan was comfort food at its finest. The Cottage Cheese is my new favorite restaurant in the city for comfort Indian food.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I have everything good to say about this place, from the intimate atmosphere, great jazz music, phenomenal food, and supreme service. New Orleans has a small space, but the way it is decorated makes you feel like an escape from reality.  The vibe is so relaxing with classic jazz to reflect the South. I brought my family here for the food. Everyone is in agreement that everything they ate was perfection.  If you know my family, you will know this is an impossibility.  Yet, there it is - the smile with every bite, the nods of approval. For myself, I ordered the mussels, which were cleaned nicely with no residue of sand.  This first course was so yummy that my expectation for the main inched higher.  The Chilean Sea Bass was the special for the night, and it was cooked beautifully.  For dessert, I was surprised with a delectable bowl of ice-cream with a birthday wish written on a plate.  Every single dish that came out was nicely presented, and truth be told, I wouldn't mind working in the kitchen so that I can learn to cook these dishes. Most importantly was the service.  Mike, who owns the establishment,  was our host.  He made sure that we were taken care of by checking in to see that everything was to our satisfaction.   What stood out about Mike was his hilarious sense of humour and kindness.  It's like as though we have known each other for a while.  That's how charming he was with everyone in the room. Truly, an evening of perfection.","Sentiment":"positive"}

My personal favourites were the Coconut crusted shrimp, the Jambalaya , the lobster and shrimp bisque and of course the beignets. The Service was speedy and staff were upbeat and friendly. The crispy coconut shrimp was served piping hot with a marmalade dipping sauce that I honestly wanted to drink like a soup on its own, a perfect complement to the shrimp. The lobster bisque was so packed with flavour , the right amount of spice and tiny bite sized bits of seafood. The jambalaya was Nice and thick. Rich with Cajun flavours and not too fishy .

Our server knew every detail we asked her about and had welcome opinions about what drinks we *should* order based on our stated taste profile preferences.

I was worried it may have been a bit bitter but it wasn't. The immersive cocktails were really cool, from what I could see from other tables.

Then before my dishes came out, I was presented with a complimentary broth. It was delicious and full of umami. Then came the belt noodle and char siu (which I could order half portion of). Both had great flavor and, as a noodle fan, it was so satisfying seeing it was . The Zha Jiang flavor was very reminiscent of Beijing and the texture was chewy and fun.

I've heard about this place from a few people, so I was excited to try it out.  Unfortunately, was pretty underwhelmed by everything.  Overall I found most of the dishes overly salty .  I don't eat pork and as some dishes had pork incorporated in them, they could put the pork separately so everyone at the table could enjoy the dish. Going with a big group we tried numerous dishes.   Pretty much everyone in the group wasn't blown away either.  I'll start with the things I liked. Chicken dumplings were pretty good, I could eat a plate of these.   The sea bass was pretty decent as well.  I did enjoy the smacked cucumber salad as well.  Fresh and crunchy, it provided a good relief to the other salty dishes (As I don't eat pork, my group ordered the Char Siu and they all raved about it...apparently the best dish they tried ) Stuffed chicken wings - found it to be too mushy inside , didn't care for the texture. The famous four foot belt noodle - this is all the Tik Tok rave, but it was way too salty for me.  Only impressed by the presentation. Supreme fried rice (pork on the side).  Again another salty dish, and for $33, was disappointed. Eggplant - ok, nothing special,  would recommend eating it fast bc otherwise it sits in the sauces and becomes more mushy. Luckily, with , the price was ok once split, but honestly felt meh  overall.  I'm glad I tried it but I don't see myself going back.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I was super excited to come here after attending famed French NYC chef Eric Ripert talk where he sang the praises of Mimi. I was mostly very whelmed with the meal.  We had a decent sized group and decided to just order off the menu instead of doing the tasting.  Everything was just fine and couldn't  really criticize anything.  The Char Siu however was fantastic.   Using Pork Belly instead of a typical butt cut is exactly what I was looking for.  It's something tasty and different.  Everything else however, wasn't necessarily an elevated version of something I could get elsewhere at a fraction of the cost. The service was fantastic and did enhance the experience for sure as great service isn't typically associated with North American Chinese restaurants. I'm glad I was able to go and cross this off my list.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This has been heralded as the best Chinese food a western . Mimi is listed on the Michelin Guide. It's the 33rd best restaurant in  according to Best Restaurants . I assume none of these people have bothered actually eating Chinese food. I don't care if I get flamed but the basics are all wrong, and anyone who's actually even just eaten Chinese food somewhat regularly in Markham\/Richmond Hill will understand exactly what I mean. The four belt noodles and dumplings both share a fatal flaw. The texture of the dough was tough and difficult to digest (). The dumplings were an insult to the other dumpling restaurants in the city -- it would be easy to get double the amount for half the price, with better flavour and non-atrociously thick wrappers that were also too doughy.  I'm pretty sure that the four belt noodle thing is just for the gram, so maybe it's our bad for ordering it. The charsiu ranged from too fatty to too dry. For this price, it would be easy to go to Extra BBQ or Sam Woo for something much more balanced and flavourful. The shrimp paste in the toast was likely machine blended. There was little trace of the bounciness of shrimp that you'd normally achieve via hand chopping the shrimp. Other than the cucumbers, all the food was luke-warm or warm at best. This place is all hype and not catered towards people who have grown up with this type of food. Stay away and instead, go to the ma and pa places, the neighbourhood places, and\/or the places that they actually list on their website. I give this place 1.. I don't care if something costs more, but if a restaurant fails at fundamentals and 6\/, I do not believe it should be on any list.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The food and the service was excellent, however. I would consider going back if they changed their corkage policy. Charge $ $. But don't mark up your wines !! In terms of dishes, I would recommend the Scallion Scallops ceviche, Dumplings in Red Oil, Truffle Turnip Cakes, Char Siu and Hunan Chili Sea Bass. You can get a similar food quality experience at a much more reasonable price if you go to Moon Palace downtown. Service and ambiance won't be as good as Mimi, though.

We started with some cocktails - Spiced Watermelon and Peach Pleassse, both pretty decent. The bread the provided was decently good as well. Being an absolute Wagyu fan, we ordered the Wagyu meatballs, beef tartare, STK & Frites, and the wagyu tacos. The wagyu meatballs and tacos were good, but I felt like the other condiments took away from the natural taste of the wagyu, so the dish wasn't spectacular. The beef tartare was good, but the STK & Frites were really the star of the show. I highly recommend.

The steak was cooked perfectly - very juicy and tender, and had alot of great flavour. My previous experience with the takeout mac and cheese was horrible, however, this time it was fantastic. The cheese sauce was rich and gooey, and the shell noodles were able to catch alot of the cheese sauce.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Super dissappointed with the food at STK, specifically takeout -- I had ordered takeout during the pandemic and heard so many great things. I had ordered the Mac and Cheese, which is showcased all over STK's social media yet looks nothing like the photos. Instead of a baked mac and cheese, I was given a container of flavourless macaroni noodles with a diluted cheese sauce that had little to no seasoning (pictured). I wouldn't expect this type of dish from STK, let alone for $18. I can't speak for the dine-in experience, but this has certainly tainted my entire view of this place.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Man I didn't want to do this because this service was amazing. There was something off with the food. Every taste had almost an overwhelming taste of flavored butter. Whether is was the filet. The Mac and cheese. The crab legs(109$ not worth it), the taters were also not worth it. The best part of the dinner was the wine. I'm 6''. The truffle butter was terrible. Horrible after taste. Horrible. I simply expected more for a 650$ meal for two people.","Sentiment":"negative"}

{"Review Text":"Walking down the street into the restaurant, you can really feel the high end atmosphere. The interior is absolutely beautiful and sleek. I came here for a friends birthday and ordered the mushroom truffle pasta. The dish was rich, creamy and flavourful! Pasta and mushrooms were cooked to perfection. This was definitely one of the better pastas I've had. I also got to try their calamari and maple smoked salmon from my friends. Both of which were quite good. However if you are planning to come here, be prepared to pay a lot. My total after tax and tips was $. The food and service was great, but you can also get similar quality food for less than half the price elsewhere.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I thought this was a great seating arrangement and the ambiance was great. The food was also super tasty! All of the dishes were good frankly. I really enjoyed having a mix of dishes and being able to taste the different flavour profiles. We had the skewers, tapioca dumplings, beef jerky, chicken, papaya salad, ling pai, drunken noodles, penang curry, massaman curry, and pandan coconut ice cream for dessert. We were very full by the end of our meal! Despite being busy, service was great and attentive. The cocktails were also very good - the tum jok especially was really unique and flavourful.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Booked a reservation during the summer of 2023. It's a nice restaurant located nearby Yonge and Wellesley. The restaurant wasn't full when we arrived but it quickly filled up. The food here is Laos but very similar to Thai\/Malaysian cuisine. The food was very well done and tasty. The biggest criticism is the table size. There was basically not enough room to put the food that was ordered. It's smaller than the traditional asian\/Chinese table, which is wider. Will come back but next time, will ask for a better table.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I came here for dinner with some coworkers  to celebrate . The restaurant at first glance looked pretty small, but they have a room  further in the back. The rooms are on the dark side, but they are atmospherically  illuminated by the light fixtures. We got a couple of dishes to share and decided to get the green papaya fritters, Lao sausage (sai kok), Lao bbq chicken (ping gai), pork skewer (moo ping), beef massaman curry , beef salad (ping sin nam tok), and drunken noodles (pad kee mao). The Lao sausage (sai kok)was very flavorful and had nice hints of lemongrass. It comes with sticky rice and mango salad. The Lao bbq chicken (ping gai)was pretty good also. It was not dry and you could really taste the mixture of lemongrass and galangal. Pork skewers  (moo ping) were tender and were accompanied by a delicious dipping sauce. For me, the beef massaman curry was just ok. Flavour was there, but I prefer my beef to be a little more tender. Drunken noodles (pad kee mao) were a highlight for me, but I also have a personal preference for flat rice noodles. They had a nice texture, and were not soggy or undercooked. I didn't really eat the beef salad (ping sin nam tok) since I don't usually eat rare beef, but my coworkers really enjoyed it, and it's quite a large portion Another standout for me were the green papaya fritters. They had a nice crunch to them and had a nice balance of sweet and sour from the papaya and the tamarind. Servers were nice and polite, and helpful with recommendations. I would come back again.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Heard many good things about Lao Lao Bar because it's the brainchild of the Sabai Sabai founders. Was super excited to check it out but was let down. Don't get me wrong... the space is beautiful and the servers are friendly and attentive. It's just the food. Ordered ping gai (Lao BBQ chicken) and a cocktail. Friend ordered sakoo yat sai (tapioca dumplings) + a drink. Was a bit surprised when the food was brought to our table. The signature plate is $, 2-. Everything tasted very average and it was nothing to write home about.  The drink was okay but not my favourite. (The one I originally wanted to order was unavailable). My friend was also unimpressed with the dumplings and felt her drink was mediocre. We finished our food and just sat there thinking... \"ummmm, that's it?\" LOL BTW, am pretty sure some will call me 'cheap' upon reading this review. I know there is inflation and the cost of goods has skyrocketed, but nearly $-in (tax and tip) for a meal like this is hefty. I've also been to Laos, Thailand, Vietnam and other parts of SEA so have experienced this type of cuisine before. It's just not worth the $$$ for ambiance. That's my .","Sentiment":"positive"}

Lao Lao Bar has a beautiful interior and delicious food that's reminiscent of Thai - more savoury and herbaceous, less sweet. I really enjoyed the Drunken Noodles, Chicken Satay, and Thai Milk Tea.

{"Review Text":"Dined here for the first time on a Wednesday night. I booked a table for . We arrived on time and were promptly seated. We were told that there was a reservation coming at 6:30pm. Indeed the restaurant filled up by 6pm. Even though we were given a window to dine, we didn't feel rushed. Food was well paced. And our small water glasses were refilled regularly without us asking - which was perfect because their food is mostly spicy. Pay attention to items on the menu marked with an asterisk which indicates the dish is served spicy! And even dishes NOT marked with the asterisk may contain chilli garnish or in the sauce served on the side. For our meal, we went with a few of our server's recommendations: Tapioca Dumpling, Green Papaya Fritters, and the Lao BBQ Chicken. Everything was delicious and flavour-packed! The highlights for me was the dumpling (sweet and savoury, with great textures) and the chicken (incredibly tender and juicy, and with the right amount of char and smokiness). The chicken dish also comes with a little serving of papaya salad and cold noodles - making it a delightfully well rounded dish with different textures and flavours all on one plate. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, erasing all signs of the previous bar restaurant that used to be in that unit. The dining rooms are large, but do make a reservation because they fill up fast.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Finally got to try Lao Lao Bar! This has been on my radar for a while, especially being a Lao spot which is hard to find in the city. My party had a reservation and was guided to a back seating area which was quieter than the front of the restaurant. Our server was really nice and provided suggestions for what to order. We had two people with dietary restrictions, but our server was understanding and able to advise if a dish could be modified to accommodate our allergies. What we got: - Lao BBQ chicken (Ping Gai) - Jeow Bong Pineapple Fried Rice w\/ Shrimp - Banana Leaf Steamed Fish w\/ sticky rice Final Thoughts: The space is beautifully decorated and the vibes are perfect for date night or catching up with friends. The food was good and I'd definitely return. My favourite was probably the Lao BBQ Chicken which also came with a mango salad and a small portion of noodles.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Lao Lao bar has been a place I've been meaning to try, and we ended up coming here for my friends birthday. As a group of approximately 8, the service was quite responsive and friendly. Food: - drunken noodles 2\/5- I was looking forward to these noodles, but it just so happened I was not a fan of the strong overpowering peppercorn taste, it definitely took over the dish, and I didn't quite enjoy it. My friend accidentally bit into the peppercorn, and was also not a fan as it was ++ spicy (the peppercorn) and over powered the dish. I can see how some people prefer the peppercorn and basil taste, but personally wasn't a fan. - tapioca balls 4\/5- with a satay like flavour, umami, savory filling, these tapioca balls were definitely one of the better items that we ordered. A great appetizer to share, packed with flavour. - satay chicken skewers 4\/5 - got these to eat with the pineapple fried rice and yummy!! Flavourful, seasoned just right and was complimented nicely with the satay sauce. A great appetizer to share as well. - pineapple fried rice 4\/5 - yummy! Probably the best item that we ordered, had proteins & a veggie mix. Quantity was great, could definitely share between two people. Filling. Flavourful. Would recommend. Overall experience was just ok. Was pretty disappointed that the menu items I was looking forward to (like drunken noodles) weren't the best. Service at the end could have done better as there was some difficulty closing out the group tab. Would I come? Don't think so. Would I recommend to try? Maybe your experience could be better!","Sentiment":"positive"}

Indian is very rarely disappointing, so Roti Cuisine of India seemed to fit the bill.

It arrived almost an hour later but was miraculously still hot. I immediately dug in and was pretty much blown away. This is easily a strong contender for best butter chicken in the city. All the flavors work so well together, and there's a complexity to the dish that kept me coming back for more. (I was sure I'd wind up leaving half for the next day but I just couldn't stop eating!)

It's not a bad thing, assuming you're fine with being told aggressively how to order (as if she's in a rush with only ), and then aggressively but in a humorous way to just dump everything in the boiling pot of soup - as if she knows I like everything .

{"Review Text":"It was one of those evenings when I wasn't up for anything heavy for dinner.  My friend suggested ginseng chicken rice noodle soup, and I thought, why not.  Something herbal will do me good.  And it proved to be the right choice.  If you haven't tried chicken ginseng soup, give it a go.  Ginseng is supposed to help with your immune system and boost your energy, which is perfect for this chilly autumn evening.  My order came within .  The soup was lightly fragrant with a myriad of flavours that tantalized the tastebud.   The soup was light and non greasy, with a touch of bitter sweetness.  It was excellent for my sensitive stomach.  There were lots of ingredients in the bubbling boiling hot bowl such as vegetables, eggs, chicken, tofu skin etc.  I also tried the fried chicken appertizer and tofu, albeit reluctantly at first because I didn't want anything heavy.  To my surprise, it wasn't oily and was  tasty.  I also drank a can of cooling herbal tea that was refreshing... a nice balance to the ginseng soup. Last but not least, the service was exceptional.  I like how the server came back with a second bowl of soup to refill. He was very thoughtful.  Thank you Fudao for your amazing hospitality.

{"Review Text":"Oh boy, where do I start? With Utsav having a four star review in Yorkville, perhaps I was expecting too much. What I ended up with was disappointment. Walking in at around 1:40pm on a Friday afternoon, I must have just missed the lunch rush. The staff appeared to be resetting all the tables. Only two tables were occupied when I arrived so it wasn't busy at all. With almost every table available, I was shown a table right next to the entrance, with the chair facing the street. I even had to wait for them to dress the table. So, I sat right next to the front door facing out. With so many tables unoccupied, this was probably the worst in the building. It's been a while since I've had butter chicken so I was really looking forward to this. A small salad arrived first. Not bad but too much cucumber for my liking. Next, the chicken and rice arrived in separate containers, along with a plate. The naan arrived a few minutes later. Everything looked good. Unfortunately, the chicken was really sweet, kinda sugary. This was a bit of a turn off for me. The rice was also very dry. Another turnoff. The naan was okay but could have been cooked just a tad longer, for my taste. This is the fourth Indian restaurant I've been to near my office (Yonge and Church\/Davenport) and have left disappointed, except for one. Maybe I should just stick to that one.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I felt compelled to write a review because the food at this place was truly terrible. I got takeout from here because it was the closest Indian place to my hotel with decent reviews. I was really looking forward to the food after a long day. Specially the lachha paratha. I was sadly extremely disappointed. I had gotten the chicken Kashmiri korma, dal makhni, butter naan and lachha paratha. The quantities were more than generous and the food was hot. But the good part ends there. All of it completely lacked flavor. I do not understand how they managed to make the dal super spicy and completely flavorless at the same time. The chicken was just ok, kind of sweet but also completely lacking flavor. The most disappointing were the breads. The butter naan was rubbery. They had either oversized the dough or kept it frozen or both. But the worst thing was the paratha. I don't think whoever runs this restaurant knows what a lachha paratha is. They took that same rubbery naan and fried it with some spices to call it lachha paratha. No layers, no flakiness, not even the right kind of dough. The prices at this place are not cheap. To serve such atrocities in the name of Indian food is a shame. I have a hard time wasting food. So, I put the generous amounts of leftovers in the fridge but I don't think I can bring myself to eat this again. It was that bad.","Sentiment":"negative"}

They were accommodating and allowed us to move. I also think it worked out because it was towards the end of the night and no one else was waiting for a table. We ordered the following: 1) Sampler Platter - LABNI, TABUL\u00c8, BABAGANUJ. It comes with pita bread and you can ask for as many refills as needed. They do not charge you for it. LABNI - homemade Lebanese yogurt cheese mixed with garlic & topped off with za'atar (Lebanese spices). There is a hint of tartness but I really like this. TABUL\u00c8 - hand chopped parsley salad with whole wheat bulgur, tomatoes, onions and a hint of mint tossed in a light lemon & olive oil dressing. Still my favourite! My friend liked this the most as well. BABAGANUJ - pur\u00e9ed BBQ eggplant lebanese tahini, garlic and fresh lemon juice. I didn't mind this but maybe I will try hummus next time or just get more TABUL\u00c8. It was interesting and my friend at first was not a big fan but it grew on them. lol. For the main - I ordered KEFTA BANADURA and my friend got the FALAFEL. KEFTA BANADURA - two juicy skewers of ground mixed lamb and beef in a tomato garlic sauce. It comes with rice and cooked peppers. I really liked that it was a more saucey dish. I think server told me it might be spicy but it wasn't that bad. I liked the little extra hint of it. FALAFEL - gluten free falafels consisting of crushed chick peas, split fava, parsley, garlic, onions and spices served with tahini. It was served over brown rice. The falafels are a bit more crispy\/harder in texture. It was okay but a bit dry personally. Similar to my previous review. For drinks - I tried BEIRUIT SANGRIA and my friend had JALLAB LEMONADE. Both were really good! BEIRUIT SANGRIA - passion fruit juice, watermelon juice, elderflower liquor, white wine, orange blossom, prosecco, fresh mint. At first I wasn't sure, but once you let it settle in more, it's soooo good! Very light and even better as a summer drink. JALLAB LEMONADE - date molasses and rose with lemon, soda, pine nuts and raisins. My friend enjoyed this one but I thought it was a bit too sweet for my taste. Perfect if you like sweet drinks! Service - Very good! We were 2nd last table, left close to closing hour but the staff never rushed us or made us feel like we were imposing. There was another large party still dining and not even finishing up yet. They probably left after closing hours but I also did not feel like staff were rushing them either. They were very accommodating and polite. Overall, STILL recommend this place. A solid nice spot for dates, work, friends or family. Expect to pay around $60+ pp if you get a starter, main and drink. Portions are filling enough, I took home a few things.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Yum yum. Tabule hits all the right spots when it comes to Middle Eastern cuisine. The decor, lighting and music is really nice and makes for a great atmosphere. This place is quite affordable if you have someone to share your meals with. My friend and I ordered quite a lot and our total was probably $. We had: - The Sampler Platter w\/ H\u00fcmmus, Babagan\u00fcj, and Tab\u00fcl\u00e8. In order of preference, I have to say Tab\u00fcl\u00e8 was the clear winner. It's so refreshing and I didn't expect to like it. Tabule at Paramount Find Foods is not even comparable. Depending on your preference, Babagan\u00fcj might be a bit too sweet. Personally, I prefer H\u00fcmmus and then the Babagan\u00fcj. You get pita bread with these spreads and can ask for free refills. If you get this platter, try one of the spreads with Tabule. - Cauliflower, was soft and pretty tasty. Nice little appetizer but not filling if that's what you are looking for. - Falafel, kind of too crunchy for me but also delicious and a tiny bit spicy. But I'm really sensitive to spicy food. My friend couldn't taste it at all though. Lol. - Lentil Soup (bowl size). It was okay, but since there is no cream or butter.. Not as smooth for me. Idk. I think I prefer it with some creamy texture so, probably pass on this one next time. Paramount makes a really great Lentil soup FYI. - Kefta, also good. The mixed lamb and beef tasted a bit salty but was balanced by the rice. We were honestly stuffed but had to try it before packing it to go. I would definitely come back here. Perhaps to try the Labni (a homemade Lebanese yogurt spread) and the teas. We spotted some diners with the Garlic Tomatoes dish, which looked interesting too. Yeah, we are foodies that eye other people's dishes for future reference. Lool.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Enjoyed Father's Day here in the back patio. Really cozy feel with attentive service. We had the tabule, hummus, sausages, and garlic tomatoes to start. All were great to snack on while enjoying the weather. Really enjoyed the pita bread that came with it and especially their house hot sauce and toum is to die for! The drinks were really refreshing too. Had the old fashioned hookah, the Arak, and a freshly squeezed mint limeade. For mains the kefta, tawuk, and lamb chops were flavourful with the lamb chops being the star. For dessert we took the kunafa ashta and muhalabiya to go with a Lebanese coffee to go enjoy by the lake since it's a close drive away.  All in all, I'm looking forward to returning to try the other apps, mains, drinks, and desserts so essentially to try everything! Honestly I'd even come by after dinner just to try some of their teas with dessert.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Traditionally, the tabule in the sampler platter ($22) wouldn't be gluten-free due to it's use of bulgur wheat. As a result, the kitchen substitutes quinoa into the finely chopped parsley, tomato, and onion salad instead, which gives it a finer and more delicate consistency. I love mixing the citrusy tabule with smoky rich babaganoush and sandwiching a spoon of it into the thin and chewy laffa ($3.), it's a great way to start the meal. In fact, you can make a whole meal from their starters with the host of other mezze options gracing the menu. From the inexpensive assorted pickles ($4.50) made up on turnips, olives, hot peppers, and dill pickles to something warm and comforting like the aaranbeet ($8.95), which is unbattered fried cauliflower that's tossed with tahini creating a warm nutty bite. Tabule's falafel salad ($14.95) continues to impress, the crispy chickpea and fava bean nuggets are deliciously fluffy, moist, and flavourful putting other falafels to shame. I do find the vinaigrette overly acidic (mixing a bit of tahini into it helps) and the dressing could use a hit more salt. If you're not into super lemony salads, I'd stick with ordering the falafels solo. The warak enab ($12.95) is also overly citrusy, which is a shame as the stuffed grape leaves are a great consistency - the leaves delicate and soft and the rice not too mushy. If only Tabule tones down the lemon seasoning and augments the tomato, garlic, and other spices instead. For something filling, go for the eggplant meal ($16.95) where slices of aubergine are fried until soft and topped with tahini and pomegranate creating a salty, sweet, and nutty main. The sauces and juices go equally well when soaked into the mujaddara, a fragrant rice studded with lentils and onions. If things become too oily or heavy, have a bite of grilled vegetables that round out the dish.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Service was excellent and attentive despite the busyness. 5\/5.  You absolutely should get a reservation. We had the dip platter and halloumi as appetizers. The halloumi was excellent but the dips lacked flavour (babbaganoush, hummus and labni) . Although I did enjoy the warm pita bread that came with the platter.  FYI one of the best dip platters can be found at Mezes on the Danforth if you're curious. Anyway, I also had the lentil soup at Tabule and Again it was ok but was a bit under seasoned. Finally my main came. Salmon kebab meal. Salmon was perfectly prepared and rice and veggies were done well. I cleaned my plate. Rice tasted very buttery yet light which I loved. I also had the kumquat \"faux jito\" as a non drinker. It was excellent ! Refreshing.

Not in a hurry to return to Tabule but certainly had some highlights.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Only  (). Treated as part of a birthday dinner from my girlfriend :) When you think of an omakase course, it's usually a sushi omakase where the focus is on the fish for the most part with a few cooked dishes that act as sides. At Yukashi, that's completely flipped where its mostly cooked small dishes with a sashimi offering snuck into the menu. For me, I think the best way to describe my experience here is, the stuff that is good, are clear 10\/10s and the stuff that is just decent are clear 6\/10s with nothing in between. No other scores in the , I either really loved it or was just ok on them. Some of the highlights (based on recollection of what it actually was lol) for me would be: - dashi soup with fish and mochi - flame torched A5 beef - mushroom tempura with cabbage - honey dew and ice cream These were very clear 10\/10s for me, with the dashi probably at a 15\/10. Hands down the best soup I've ever tasted. Clear, rich, light all at the same time. Experience wise, Chef Daisuke did a great job making conversation with all the guests, encouraging us to share our thoughts on the dishes and giving background on each dish. After the dessert is served, he basically just chats with everyone for . Really love how he makes an effort to chat about his experience and of course to hear the background of the Michelin Star.

{"Review Text":"This was truly an unforgettable kaiseki experience -  Yukashi exceeded my every expectation and I can't wait to be back again for more of the chef's creativity. From the moment you step into the intimate and welcoming space, you know you're in for a special meal. The restaurant space is modern, but still manages to evoke a sense of tradition. But it's the food that truly takes center stage at Yukashi. The kaiseki menu is a true work of art, featuring a series of small, carefully crafted courses that showcase the best of Japanese cuisine. The sashimi was incredibly fresh and flavorful, the beef foie gras role was simply a flavour explosion, and the other dishes were both creative and delicious. And let's not forget the sake pairing! The restaurant's sake sommelier is truly an expert in their craft, and each sake pairing explored different flavours and complimented well with the dishes. Overall, I highly recommend Yukashi to anyone looking for an unforgettable kaiseki experience in Japan. From the fresh sashimi to the creative dishes and expertly paired sake, every aspect of the meal was truly exceptional.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"One of the most memorable meals I've had in a long long time. From the food to the staff, everything was phenomenal. We ordered the . I'm not going to lie, I'm not sure what everything is but I can tell you what really stood out to me. The soup (3rd pic) was light yet rich with umami flavours, with a fish\/egg ball and pieces of shrimp. The tuna belly (1st slide) was so rich and fatty it just melts in your mouth. And the other fish (don't remember what it's called) with the seasoning on top, dipped with the chefs home made sauces was delicious. The highlight of my meal however was the torched certified A5 wagyu with uni and foie gras paired with the leaf. The flavours were so rich and buttery but the leaf gave it a great earthy flavour. The fish in the 5th picture, which was the main was absolutely delicious, seasoned well but still light and cooked to perfection. The 6th was probably the most interesting dish, an egg custard with some sort of fresh water plant which naturally has that jelly like substance around it. It was different but delicious, kind of like a crunchy tapioca. The melon will always be my favourite desert. So rich and juicy The chef was fantastic, he explained the ingredients and taught us what paired well together and even had a glass of sake with us. He was meticulous with the food and was a true artist behind the counter. It was inspiring watching him and was visible he loves what he does, as it shows through his food. We will surely be back!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Yukashi is undoubtedly my favourite tasting menu I've had the pleasure of going to not only for the food, but for the experience as well. Chef Daisuke is well practiced in Japanese cuisine and puts his twist on his menu. Chef Daisuke's humble charm, Japanese humor (complete with self-deprecating jokes) make the meal an enjoyable experience. As with all tasting menus, I refrain from commenting on the food as 1. Items are seasonal, and 2. Prior knowledge may affect the experience. For the best experience, get the sake pairing (Make sure you try them before and after the dish). Also try and get the bar seats closest to the kitchen for a more intimate setting with the chefs! On a final note, big congrats to the team for the Michelin star. A much deserved recognition.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I was there for an engagement party in an area I was unfamiliar with but the food, service, and venue were all outstanding! We had the party room on the second floor. It was nicely set up, with casual seating, intimate lighting, lots of space to mingle, a nice bar and patio out back, washrooms (with a shower in one), and lots of art hanging on the walls. Very nicely done! It was a casual setup for food, starting with a Cheese Platter, Oysters on the Half Shell, Olives, and Flatbreads. The veggie courses were next with a delicious Romaine Garden Salad, Crispy Brussels Sprouts, Crispy Green Beans with a delicious Truffle Aioli, and Wild Boar Meatballs. Pizza was the last course and they were certainly worth the wait. We got a variety, all cooked in a wood-fired oven and all delicious! I was kinda full by this time but I managed to sample a couple of different ones and they were outstanding. This was the best pizza I've had in a very long time! Besides the great venue and delicious food, the service was excellent, especially with only three staff to handle greeting, serving, clearing, tending the bar, and operating the dishwasher on the fly. Great job! Although this was a private event in their party room, I can only imagine the restaurant on the ground floor would be just as good. Give them a try. I would definitely come back!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I love Defina, it's been a longtime favourite that my family and I frequented regularly when I lived in the neighbourhood. The last TWO weekends, my husband and I took our kids for pizza since we had errands nearby. The first weekend, a kind and apologetic man opened the door (we began waiting at noon for the door to open, he came to the door shortly after when he saw us) and explained that the server was late for work but we could come in and sit down. 't arrived, so the man who answered the door offered to start our pizzas - I guess he was the cook? It was an inconvenience as one of our kids is , but we figured it was likely just an off day. The server bustled in looking dishevelled (hungover?), but the food was great, and we left happy. Today, we had to go back to Roncy to pick up something I had dropped off the weekend before for repairs. We planned our trip around going back to Defina because the kids loved it and wanted more, and we showed up again near opening, which is 12pm. We got there at almost 12:10pm, and we walked in. The place was empty. We waited for a few minutes, wondering if we should sit down. Then the same server comes out from the back and tells us it will be another , the fire in the oven wasn't even on yet and it wouldn't be hot for a while. As once again we were there with hungry kids, we left, annoyed, and went to Barque down the street instead. For a popular restaurant that is supposed to be open for business at noon, having the only server arrive almost a half hour late on a busy Saturday - and the very next Saturday not having the fire or kitchen ready to cook orders until almost an hour after opening is ridiculous and sloppy. Bottom line is that the food is great, but clearly the service and organization has gone downhill and leaves a lot to be desired. Too bad.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I had the Resy app to confirm that I reserved the DuPont location but the strongly implied it wasn't their fault and couldn't honour my reservation. It was an inconvenience and there was no apology or acknowledgment and although I didn't want to go to the Roncey location - I was left on a busy night with no other possibility of a table somewhere else. The server clearly didn't want to be there-didn't crack a smile or even attempt a personality. Puzza was average with skimpy toppings. Spicy Margarita was also underwhelmimy.

{"Review Text":"We were in the area and finding food was relatively easy on Roncesvalles. We came across Pizzeria Defina and decided to grab their popular wood-fired pies. The lady at the cash was kind and explained the sizes of their pizzas. Ultimately, we ordered a 12\" Margherita Pizza, the total came out to $18.65. The presentation of the box was well done, it showcased a man tossing a pizza in the air while flexing his right arm. Let's get into the pizza, it featured plum tomato sauce, fior di latte, grana padano, & basil. Yes, the smell of the wood-fired pizza and the pungent smell of basil was apparent. We sat down, opened the box and there she was. A decent amount of plum tomato sauce followed by a nice layer of fior di latte (semi-soft mozzarella) and basil scattered across the surface. I did notice the crust of the pizza was black, I prodded at the dark spot and it immediately crumbled away. I didn't mind since it was at the edge of the pie. I decided to take a bite of the thin crusted pizza, I can really tell the plum tomato sauce was hitting me in every way possible - sweet, tangy and tarty. I couldn't pick up the flavour on the grana padano, but the fior di latte gave a light and delicate touch. The basil unfolded a minty and slightly bitter aftertaste which completed this Margherita pizza. But let's not get too far ahead of ourselves now. I did notice a burnt taste lingering in my mouth with all of the wonderful ingredients. I lifted up the pizza and problem presented itself, dark burnt spots were everywhere. This was a disappointment for me, given if the pizza was perfect it would have been scored higher. However, I don't mind coming back here and giving it another shot. -TwoHappyThumbs","Sentiment":"positive"}

It's a pretty nice looking place and was quite busy when we walked in. The staff that got us a seat was very attentive and made sure we got a spot quickly. After ordering the motzarella bar, we were told that it was '86ed - the ONLY reason I knew what that meant was because of too much kitchen nightmare episodes. We then switched to the Patagonia ($26) The dish had a really nice skirt steak topped with a very salty and fishy crab topping. It ended up being a fishy meat and was a little confusing. Another confusing part of the plate was the arugula with blueberries and pickled eggplant. I like all three things, but together, they confused me! The cassava mash with the Stearns was quite nice and so was the fried provolone. For the pizza, we got the diavola ($14). This was really good. Thin and light. Just the way I like it.

{"Review Text":"We can't wait to visit the actual Hole in the Wall bar once we can drink and eat inside... but we're so happy to have discovered Botham's in the meantime for take-home DONUTS and PIZZA! Donuts: fresh and homemade, interesting icings aren't too sweet. I've especially love the filled ones, generous, busting with real fruit or curd... a favorite was a lemon iced one with lemon curd. Pizza: Incredible dough, dark sourdough. Crust so good you're tempted to put butter \/ garlic butter on them. Favorites: the Sausage and Smoked Provolone pizza - the sausage is so flavorful. I usually don't love white pizzas, but this one's not dry or boring. The Bacon pizza - I love anything ham and pineapple, so....  The bacon on this one is almost too smoky for me but if there's a generous helping of pineapple and basil, it works. From Monday to Wednesday, there's a take-out deal on pizzas -  $25 (a surcharge for a couple varieties). That's an incredible deal for these pies. Wines: a lot to interesting bottles to choose from for take home, at reasonable prices.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Portici was ok, nothing outstanding but also not bad. Got the eggplant walnut dip (good amount, standard taste), pinsa contadina (liked how it had a smokiness to it but would have liked more toppings since the bread part was overpowering) and seafood lasagna (super cheesy so yum, but would have liked more seafood). Great patio. Service was friendly and efficient. Prices were good, especially for the Yorkville area.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Met up with a friend at Four Seasons on a Sunday. We had planned to eat but didn't pick a restaurant so when she mentioned Portici, I was happy to try it out. She recommended it for the pizza but when we got there they informed us they only make breakfast. We gave it a  go anyways. This restaurant is by Yorkville but not in the thick of it so even though we sat outside and did a bit of people watching, it was very calm and less crowded. Also, the staff was really sweet which added to the pleasant atmosphere. The food all tasted good. I went with the avocado toast and it was quite nice, though if I'm being honest nothing that stands out as being truly unique. The mimosa was also a nice balance of juice and alcohol. Being so close to Yorkville, this place is fairly expensive. I think my meal was over $ (where the bread wasn't toasted but was fresh) and a mimosa. However, the quality was good so I was okay spending what I spent, especially given the area.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"It's a nice place. Friendly service. Sadly, I am only giving three stars (at least for now). First, the chicken penne I ordered was a surprisingly mild and a bit bland for my taste. Don't get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with the food. Just made a wrong pick. Second, bees (or wasps?) kept sitting on the food while we were eating at the patio. It was quite bothersome. As much as it's not the restaurants direct fault, it just destroyed the experience. Having said all that, it's a decent restaurant, and I am quite willing to go back. I look forward to editing my review for the better.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I had some time to waste while waiting for an appointment but it was too early to have dinner. I just needed something light to bridge the gap. I remember walking past Caffe di Portici a few weeks ago so I thought I'd see what they have. Oh, I thought this was a coffee shop. It's much more than that! It's an Italian restaurant that happens to serve coffee. They serve all kinds of Italian food here, including salad, pasta, sandwiches, pizza, desserts, and much more. All I want is a coffee, this time. My friendly server had actually greeted me before I stepped inside and was very helpful in walking me through their menu. With his help, I chose the Espresso Crema Shakerato - A layer of cold milk cream over iced coffee frothed in a shaker & flavour shot. It sounded really good on a hot day. It was good! Rich and creamy. I'll have to come back to try some of their food.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"A pleasant surprise for us walking back to the hotel from the LCBO that was a train station. Just looking for something to eat and found this place. All we had was a pizza, but it was perfect and priced well. Much better than a pizza bar or stand. We sat outside beside the mini-park on the corner and enjoyed out time. I had an Aperol Spritz which was also perfect and larger than I expected.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This is a pleasant surprise, the Italian style eggplant lasagna, mushroom soup, bruschetta were all delicious, the flowers surrounding the patio, and nearby parkette feels calming and ideal for a good conversation.

{"Review Text":"This place is a decent find in this area. I came here for a last min brunch on a weekend as most of the other bookmarked spots nearby had a wait. Place is a simple and too the point. I ordered the smoked salmon with a bagel and it came with a side of a bean salad and fresh fruit on the side. The cappuccino I ordered was forgettable. Poorly frothed milk and a bitter shot. No latte art. I don't enjoy lavazza beans much so too each their own here. The smoked salmon was decent and I enjoyed the salad as it was decent. Service is OK. Once one factors in the price component for this area it is a bit of bargain and a good value for this area. .","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Eating around Yorkville can sometime be a dawning task. Most places would charge $$$$ for a simple meal.  But if you are looking for a nice little corner cafe that serves up some fancy yummy food without the heavy price tag, wait no more! Caffe Di Portici is your kinda Resturant! Highlight of the visit: Brunch pizza! Any of the pizza are super yummy. They are thin crust and cooked to perfection.  Especially when Rami, the head French chef hits up behind the oven.  He's very friendly and often comes to tables for their feedback.  This place is my go to for a quick brunch or after work hangout!

{"Review Text":"Fishman's is a upscale Chinese cuisine establishment that has a modern decor and a very warm and welcoming atmosphere. A great place for friends and family gathering! Its loud but it gives off such a warm environment. Service was great! Had multiple managers always on floor looking for ways to assist you! There were serving assistants as well to cater to your needs. Food was nice and fresh and in my opinion Fishman's is one of the best Chinese cuisine house that makes Chinese style fried lobster. Their salted egg yolk fried lobster that was absolutely amazing! Salted egg yolk mixed with panko\/batter crumbs on fried lobster was truly a tasty experience packed with umami. The fried lobster was also accompanied with fries, but not just fries... costco fries! Everything was amazing including the side dishes like the crab fried rice and vegetables!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I don't really understand the hype I've seen over this place... I guess there's the experience of taking a picture with the giant crab when they bring it over to your table to show you what will be cooked (cost is based on market price x weight), and there's that lobster mountain dish you can order... but the taste of the food wasn't anything special in my opinion. Though not bad, you can get similar flavours in many other Chinese restaurants around the GTA for a much cheaper price, hence why I'm giving this place . The cost didn't seem to be worth it's quality. The atmosphere is also like any other Chinese restaurant uptown, a large dining room with lots of round tables, and some fish tanks with the live animals that they will eventually serve. The service was good though, as the servers were attentive, and quick on all requests. One key thing to keep in mind is that they ONLY ACCEPT CASH OR DEBIT.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"My husband and I dined here for the first time on a Friday evening. We had made a reservation beforehand because we were unsure how busy the restaurant was going to be. The restaurant was empty when we arrived. We ended up having their Vancouver crab, pork and Hong Kong style lobster. Everything was soo delicious! Me and my husband were in awe of how delicious the food was. I am not a huge fan of pork, so I was skeptical about ordering it. Thank goodness I ordered it! The pork was tender, sweet and just so so delicious. We also decided to have their Hong Kong style lobster as a tower, which was a LOT of food. But my husband and I made it a point to finish all of the lobster. Not too spicy at all, just a great mixture of sweet and salty. The lobster was super fresh and cooked perfectly! As for the crab, it was different but still very good. Our waitress was so great, she treated us like her kids and provided great recommendations. Everyone was very attentive during our dine in, ensuring our plates were cleared off the table and refilling our waters. Overall, we had a great experience, the food was delicious and fresh. The staff was amazing. We had such a unique experience and cannot wait to return here in the future!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Do you know how there are tiers in a video game? Well this restaurant is truly an S-tier Chinese restaurant. The food served here is the best I had. The dining area is surrounded with live lobster and king crab in their tanks. You know it is very fresh . We started off with the sweet and sour pork, and beef with fried garlic. Probably the best I have ever had. The flavor is on point and I want to go back for more. As soon as they brought that huge lobster tower, I was shook... Never in a billion years that I will see such beauty. The steam crab is really good and it is not to heavy in terms of flavor compared to the lobster. The vegetables are also flavorful and it helps cut the heaviness down from the seafood. Overall, literally the best seafood I had in my life!","Sentiment":"positive"}

But some say it's overpriced, and the lobsters aren't very fresh. Luckily our lobster was good and we enjoyed the whole experience. We ordered a Hong Kong style lobster. However, it didn't taste very Hong Kong. The sauce was a bit too sweet, overpowering the original taste of the lobster. The oysters were fresh, but I didn't like how the sauce was separated from them, and the coating was too thick. They were salty and not very flavorful. The fried rice was good though, but it lacked what we call in Chinese \"\u944a\u6c23\" The bill came out to be $, which was reasonable, but I believe there are Chinese restaurants with cheaper prices and better quality. If you're here for the ambiance and photo opportunities then this is the place for you.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"It's been a while since the last time I dined at this restaurant (blame COVID). A group of us decided it's been long overdue for a gathering and everything for the sake of the \"gram\", we picked fishman lobster for their infamous seafood meals. We decided on a \"two lobster dinner set\" to be shared amongst us (group of 7). The portions of each dish were certainly enough for each of us and all of us left with a happy full tummy! The highlight was definitely the lobsters! Personally, I loved the HK style the most- garlic flavour was strong with a hint of spice, the fries were also fried to perfection, something I bet every kid would LOVE to eat... even for us adults we fight for those fries! The beef tenderloin was also memorable as they were so tender, accompanied by crispy fried garlic pieces was just ADDICTIVE! The sweet and sour pork was crispy and despite them being saucy, each piece of pork was still really crispy and still able to maintain a bit of crunch in every bite. Honestly, I don't have anything to complain about the experience. Was service lacking? Not really as I thought it was quite attentive for a Chinese fine dining restaurant- servers would come around and change out your plates full of lobster shells and provide clean ones. Pricing wise I thought it was reasonable with roughly $.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We arrived at 2pm Sunday afternoon and there was no wait since the lunch crowd was just starting to thin a bit. What we got: 2.- 6. & Gogi Berry Jelly dessert Entering the restaurant was quite a view! Definitely one of the fancier and nicer Chinese restaurants we've  been to! The walls were covered in fish tanks housing lobsters, king crabs, and high end bottles or liquor. Wait staff was a little slow but no one was rude. They had headsets on which helped the setting because from our experience, big or small Chinese establishments usually have wait staff yelling across the room of each other and they are working so fast it may come as off as rude, but none of that here. As for the food, I've had this place bookmarked for years so I was really excited to finally check the place out. I'm happy to report that the food lived up to its hype! We were going to order everything a la carte since there was only 't think we needed the side dishes in the combos but the waiter suggested the combo because the price per pound is cheaper and you still you get more food. So he suggested the K1 combo and the lobster as a la carte and made some adjustments based on how we wanted the seafood cooked. We were so happy we went for the combo! Once the order was placed, they brought out the live king crab and lobster to show us what they'll be cooking and they brought out stickers that show how many pounds they were that determine the price. A few minutes passed and they brought out the lobster and the kind crab in all their glory and we dug in! Both were cooked really well that they weren't rubbery at all! They were soft, tender, and oh so yummy! The hk style came with a slightly sweet sauce with some crunchies that made it so good! Even the fries with the crunchies and sauce tasted really good! The king crab fried in maggi sauce was also really good but I wish you could taste a little bit more of the maggi sauce. Next time, I'll reverse the cooking styles! I also enjoyed the snow pea tips as a change of flavor throughout the meal. The fried rice was good. The dessert was okay. We had some left overs as well which we brought home and had for dinner after air frying it!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Prompt service once you have snagged yourself a table but make sure to add your name to the waitlist ahead of time - either in person or online through Yelp. It can get pretty buzzing during the day. We ordered the Mediterranean Shakshuka and the French Toast. The Shakshuka (5\/5) with our chosen Challah bread was a big hit. They have a variety of shakshuka combinations but the one with eggplant caught our eyes - and in retrospect for all the right reasons. The French Toast (3\/5) was nicer in theory but didn't hit the ball out of the park for me. There was some bitter element in the granola which could have worked well with the maple syrup but it still felt odd at times. The bread could have been a little less on the drier side. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the vibe, and savory dish offered. I see myself trying something different - on the sweeter side next time.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Some nitpicks but mostly very good and worth it! The service was a little long for not being super busy, but the staff was extremely kind and friendly so it didn't bother us to wait a bit. The food was great! We ordered the pita sandwich and the pulled pork burger and they were out of the park good. I will say, the coffee was not great-just the regular drip is pretty basic and the mocha was not good, It was kind of watery too which was odd, and had clumps of chocolate in the bottom. I didn't try the Turkish coffee in the menu but it did look and smell amazing! I'm pretty certain had we ordered that it would have been well worth it. The salad and stuff that the Sandwich came with was fairly basic, just lettuce and light dressing, but that's fine for what you're paying-if upgrade your sides if you get something that comes with the standard salad. The ambiance is super cool-I really enjoy they're whole vibe. It's very aesthetic and kind of retro. I would still defintley recommend the place, especially as a brunch spot, it's relatively affordable and the food is great.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Service was really quick and the portions were generous, but definitely a bit messy to eat! we also ordered the Landwer famous ice tea which I would skip out on next time.

We arrived just before .m. and the place was quite busy- it had a lively vibe. A young lady was our waitress for the evening. She brought our menu and stepped away to give us some time to read the menu. When she came back, we ordered a vanilla milkshake (boyfriend's drink), an apple cider (my drink), grilled salmon (boyfriend's main) and Mediterranean shakshuka (my main). Our drinks arrived first, so we talked while sipping our drinks. I enjoyed the warm apple cider warming me up on a cold evening. My boyfriend enjoyed the cool sweet taste of vanilla. Then our main dishes arrived, and we couldn't wait to eat! My dish, Mediterranean shakshuka, was delicious- the veggies were soft and chewy, the eggs were soft and lightly crispy, and the tomato base underneath was a bit salty to balance the flavour of the dish. My boyfriend said his dish, grilled salmon with veggies was also delicious- it was juicy and succulent. We were too full to eat dessert, so we decided to come back and try that on another day.

{"Review Text":"Tasty food, good quality, pricey but worth it. My wife and I had lunch here and got: - Molasses Bread: OMG this alone would make me come back! The bread is homemade goodness, while the miso flavour of the butter really differentiates it. - Grilled Octopus: Octopus is a great test of how good a restaurant does seafood. Eastside Social kills it - great grill and char, with the meat ever-so-tender. Only downside is the portion size is really small for the price. - Fish and Chips: Haddock is meaty and the batter coating is tasty and not overly thick. Fries are thick and on the right side of saltiness, and the slaw is sweet and refreshing. Only quibble is I would have liked two pieces of fish for the price. - Mussell Frites: Undisputed star of the meal. Mussels were fresh and plentiful and perfectly cooked (not rubbery at all). The sauce was amazing (white wine that was spiced up with garlic and chili flakes). And of course, those yummy fries again. - Eastside Mess: Perfect capper to the meal, this dessert is summer on a plate. The lemon curd is properly sour, the berries are properly fresh, the meringue chunks add a pop of texture and sweetness, and the chantilly cream finishes it off. Service is quick and friendly, with great suggestions. Overall, Eastside Social was an absolute delight.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"The service here stands out. I don't want to take away from the excellent food, but the staff makes this place shine. I brought my girlfriend here on her birthday, and our server made out night easy and memorable. I've tried the fish and chips, pok\u00e9 bowl, fries, and muscles here and have enjoyed every bite. I am looking forward to enjoying the beautiful patio once again in the summer.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"First time here and I was pleasantly surprised by the size of their back patio! It was definitely a vibe and better than sitting on the Queen Street 'patio' beside the traffic. This place is a solid 4\/5. We started with the sea bream tostada which was a ceviche. It was REALLY good except that the portion was really small for $22. Definitely not enough if you're the kind to think, \"I'll get two appetizers as a meal\". BF had the risotto, which was really only OK. It definitely needed salt, and tasted like it was simmered in a veggie broth and not a chicken broth, which would have made it more flavourful. I wouldn't recommend it. I had the mussels frites and I was surprised by the portion of the mussels. They were cooked well, and we were happy to have the fries after the small appetizer. Would come back to try the fish tacos.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Once again another excellent meal served by amazing staff! Menu has changed. Some new items like the East Side Mess dessert. Berries, meringue and a creamy deliciousness! So freaking delicious! Donairs are now a lunch only option. Sad face. Steak done to perfection. Clam chowder was yum! Beet salad to go, for lunch tomorrow. And Marty was here tonight. Crazy funny guy! Love him!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I was in the neighbourhood last weekend and popped by for some clam chowder and a Donair. Delicious as usual. I can't wait until they can reopen and I can sit down and enjoy my meals while it's fresh and hot. Downside to lockdown is having to take your food to-go so it's never hot by the time you get home. Jason was a sweetheart and offered to carry my walker down the two steps for me. It's not often an owner sees me with the walker and thinks to offer assistance getting in\/out of their business. I don't expect every business to be able to make themselves wheelchair accessible but at least offer to help out. I've always loved Eastside for the food AND customer service. I can't wait for Marty Mondays! I miss that funny sweet man! You have to go on a night Marty is working. Go in sad, come out a happy camper! That kind of guy!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Fat Pasha is a restaurant that you should go to if you like middle eastern food. The menu -- albeit not super extensive -- has a great selection. However, it is quite expensive. For example: $. Anyway, onto the food. Very good! We got a platter and the cauliflower as starters, then two plates. LOTS OF FOOD. The platter was a great way to try all of the dishes. I loved the squash one and the babaganoush. The pita was so nice and fluffy as well!! Super warm too!! The cauliflower was pretty good but definitely not worth $. The two plates we're great but by the time it came out we were already quite stuffed. Brisket had great flavour but I actually preferred the mashed chickpeas. The seafood was amazing, but the latke was really really salty (maybe I just need to up my salt tolerance). We had no room for dessert, but if I were to go back I'd love to try the Israeli Cheesecake. The server lady was great, she did an amazing job at explaining what was on our plates and the menu as a whole. The restaurant itself is not the biggest, but it didn't get too loud or anything. A good time to come is 6pm. Would I go back? Maybe. Do I recommend? Yes, but I also think you can find great middle eastern restaurants elsewhere for more reasonable prices. 7.5\/10","Sentiment":"positive"}

The schug has nuanced flavour, not the usual \"this schug tastes like burning\" schug. The shawarma is juicy, fully cooked yet tender. The lox, eggs and onions is perfect. The eggs are fluffy, the onions caramelized without being burned and the lox is still tender.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Small, quaint charming place with tasty, high-quality food and a nice wine selection at reasonable prices. My husband loved the steak (the feta scalloped potato side is so good we ordered ). I love the crespelle (with spinach in a rose sauce) and both of us adored the fried feta appy. Service is efficient and friendly-a local gem for sure.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We happened upon this gem while going to another restaurant in the neighbourhood. The other restaurant we planned to visit was unavailable for dining in, so we opted for this one. We don't live in the area. It was a pleasant surprise after reading the reviews. I can see that this is an area with many Spanish\/Latinos, and the restaurant had the South American flare. We ordered the mussels as appetizer. It came in a good portion and was fresh and delicious. I decided to get the whole sea bass as my main course as I missed having one since I was in Europe last year. It truly gave me the feeling of dining in Europe. The service was friendly and the atmosphere was classy and quaint. They have lots of regular customers who knew the owner by name which just shows that this place is popular in the neighbourhood. It's just a lovely experience.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"With all the glowing reviews, I was expecting a lot more. My wife and I came here for dinner, and the place was nice (cozy\/homey\/comfy) and service was great (friendly and quick). But we're mostly here for the food, and that was just ok for us. We had: - Eggplant parmigiana: Pretty standard taste,  good serving size. - Arugula salad with peaches, walnuts and gorgonzola: Pretty standard taste. Loved that there were huge slices of pear, though would have liked more gorgonzola (just a tiny cube). - Sea bass with puttanesca tomatoes, capers and salted brocolli (special for the night): The fish was ok (decent size, fresh enough). The star of the dish though was the tomatoes, which were soaked through with the puttanesca flavour. - Creme brulee: Nice and smooth, though bordering on too runny. Barista and Chef was perfectly ok. I guess I was just hoping for more.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"So, we attended on a Sunday July evening and it was new to us, in a friendly neighborhood.  We were comfortable and seated soon after arrival. The restaurant was popular with casually dressed older couples eating outside, and the music inside was not overwhelming for holding a conversation.  Inside we could sit at a window, away from other tables, so we were at home. There was complimentary bread, a variety of food on the menu -  they describe their menu as eclectic Mediterranean.  The beet salad was well made by and the pasta was excellent.  The fish was beautifully plated but not as fresh as expected. I would like to go back and sample the menu some more. We paid about , which was enabled with extra plates without hassle by the waiter.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"We came here for a snack as I was shopping in the area. Both of us ordered the fries. After receiving our drinks we received a plate of fresh, warn bread & homemade hummus. Delicious! Then our fries came after & it was dressed with sprinklings of green onion & feta cheese with a side of a creamy sauce. I wasn't expecting this & since I'm lactose intolerant I scraped the cheese off the fries & gave them to hubby even though they offered to make a plate without dairy. Long story short the fries were hand cut & obviously homemade. They were scrumptious. We would eat here again when we're next in the area. The decor is modern & classy yet casual. The owner told us they just opened a few months ago.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"The Hubster and I had a very nice dinner here. We sat out on the patio and had the beef cheeks\/tongue to start, tagliatelle ragu for me and the burger for him. The appetizer is a winner. The cheeks are super tasty, soft and fatty and the tongue had a great bite to it. The pasta was fantastic and WAY too big for me. I tried my best but at the end, maybe ate half of it. The sauce was very good and the bites of beef brisket were heavenly. The Hubster very much enjoyed his gigantic and juicy burger. He couldn't finish it, either. Service was excellent, a great mix of genial while quiet and professional. This is a fantastic spot for a romantic dinner.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I asked for a dessert to sing happy birthday, and he sent over a different staff member. No utensil's whatsoever, I don't blame the girl who brought over the dessert.

{"Review Text":"Hidden on Dundas West of Bathurst, this Italian eatery is an absolute gem.  Energetic, busy, noisy in a good way.  Enjoyed a wonderful appetizer of flattened, seasoned meatballs -  MONDEGHILI and then my main - gnocchi with artisanal sausage, mushrooms and truffles - GNOCCHI CASERECCI AL TARTUFO and accompanied it with an absolute wonderful glass of Abramo riserva barrique-le rive. But what made this experience that much better was the attention and service from the bartender.  She was extraordinarily nice, attentive and did not try to insert herself into my experience beyond need.  Yes, I sat at the bar. Absolutely wonderful experience and will definitely be back with friends.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Northern Italian style food, a bit different from your traditional Italian food. Overall the food is decent, however, I find it extremely oily and greasy in some cases, more like your typical Italian pasta. For two of us, we had an appetizer, two pasta, and a meat dish, glass of wine, sparkling water. Total about 200. You can get better Italian food for way less in my opinion. Service was great, but it's not a place I would go back frequently, not worth the money imo.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Meal Quality:  Started with a Sciatt appetizer that was delightfully crunchy on the exterior and filled with a smooth & creamy cheese on the interior.  For the main course, I was very impressed by their Risotto alla Milanese con Ossobucco.  Its saffron risotto was was the best that I have ever had and the braised veal shank was sheer perfection!  I paired this with a delicious glass of Cabernet Franc that even further brought out the flavors of the ossobucco.  As for dessert, sometimes it is best not to choose just one, so the Torta di Mele e Gelato and the Tiramisu were decadent choices and I paired it with a nice Italian liqueur. Aesthetic Appeal & Atmosphere: Enjoyed a nice evening outdoor meal on a lively street Service: My waitress was phenomenal and very helpful.  As she was a former customer herself, she essentially ordered gave me her personal recommendations and I followed them the whole way through the evening.  She said it was her first day, but I'd swear she had been perfecting her craft for many years! RATINGS: Meal Quality:  & Atmosphere: : A blazing !","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I just have to share this so you order it knowing what it is. We ordered the BBQ plate @ $36 + tax + 20% tip = $48. Photos attached. The plate is an appetizer size not dinner size even though it is a secondi, the lemon wedge gives proportion. The chicken tasted the way it looks and there was only one piece. The rib was really one rib because the 2nd piece at the bottom was the fatty cartilage cut from the top piece. The sausage was fine.  So one rib, one steamed thigh and one sausage for ~ $50. We did enjoy the risotto tartufo, ossobuco and orecchia but the BBQ plate was not enjoyed.  I don't normally do this but I would have appreciated this info before ordering the BBQ plate.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I was absolutely delighted to discover this restaurant. A place that is dairy free and sesame free is difficult to come across. When you finally find one, you often find yourself regretting that discovery because it's not all that great. But here? The Hogtown Vegan? It was great. There are some amazing IPAs on tap for the grownups in the party, and there are some fantastic meal options. The burger passed the kid-test. And it past the adult-test. It's really good. I wish I was eating it right now. The chick-un fingers are very sneaky. Their fried and have a great texture, and when eaten without sauce you can taste what they're made of and the illusion might fall apart. However, one dip in the sauce, and you'll have no idea that it's anything other than a nice firm crispy finger! And, honestly, what are we doing if not eating all the sauce? The water is plentiful and comes in large glass bottles you can pour yourself, so you're never sitting around with an empty cup. And, beyond that, there are desserts. Desserts that are good! The waffle fingers are pretty tasty treats. I wish I ate them before my meal. Although, who am I kidding? I was never going to finish my meal anyway. The burger, and the fingers, came served on top of a basket of fries so large, they'd be a great table-share portion all on their own! In the immortal words of a former California governor... I'll be back!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Firstly don't get the impression that the food here is healthy because it's vegan. About 60% of the menu is deep fried.  I ordered the brunch  French toast, It was literally dripping in oil. I mentioned it to the waiter, He didn't apologize or offer to bring me anything else or give me a discount. They're obviously cooking it in oil at the wrong temperature. I wasn't impressed with the service, It was one of those I'm doing you a favor by serving you situations.","Sentiment":"negative"}

I was definitely pleased with the pick of dishes my friends and I selected and would indeed be back to try more. I was here for the potato cream udon but disappointed to discover it was paired with a beef udon dish. However the waitress was kind enough to tell me that they could make it with vegetarian curry and make the entire dish vegetarian friendly. I seriously appreciated that the menu was so accessible dietarily! It was such a warm cozy dish, I absolutely loved it. The oven baked cheese udon was the best of the two and reminiscent of Alfredo and carbonara in many ways. The udon itself was soft and had the perfect chew and don't be fooled as I was to think portions weren't that big. Everything was very filling.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I'm happy to say that the udon here has improved compared to the last time I visited, although that was a while ago. The flavour of the broth, the texture of the noodles, and the portion sizes are now above average (or, well, my standards for \"average\" have had to decrease a bit). We all ordered the udon dishes with clear soup bases, and highly enjoyed the savoury but not overpowering taste (no food comas reported after the meal). We came on a busy Friday evening and service was alright - our waitress came to our table just as many times as strictly necessary. It's quite a crowded space here, definitely come prepared to speak loudly to be heard. Regardless, no one rushed us out the door which we appreciated. There are a few new items on their menu which I'm curious about, so I'll probably be back for those! :)","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Menami is unique in that it's probably the only restaurant that specializes in udon instead of ramen or pho or crossing-the-bridge noodles, all of which there are a multitude. So, there isn't really much in way of comparison. Easily a leg up from the usual udon you get in a typical Japanese place, though! Ordered a couple of their soup udons. The highlight of the meal was indisputably the broth. Very rich in flavour but not overly seasoned. The noodles themselves were also quite good, but not remarkably so - more chewy and tougher than I expected, though this could just be a personal preference. What was somewhat disappointing was the lack of ingredients, as the seafood udon only had a couple of shrimp and calamari and a bunch of empty mussels, and the pork udon did not end up having much pork...they were both unfortunately more like \"bean sprouts\/onion udon\". For the price, I would honestly expect a better proportion and not this obvious skimping. Service was alright. The waitress was friendly enough and not overbearing. I was surprised at how slowly the food came out, given that we were there on a weekday at a time when it was pretty much empty. Or maybe that's just my hanger talking haha. The interior was very nice, plenty of seating and cute decor, although I can definitely see how it could get crowded and uncomfortable quickly on a busier night. I'm glad I gave this a try, but I probably won't be back until I have an absolute craving for udon again - it's more of a one time thing than a go-to spot.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Taco Wasabi - I've had this dish before and this one had way too much Wasabi in my opinion. It was almost uneatable - the sting that would hit your nose hurt really bad and I've never experienced that with other Taco Wasabis. The Fresh Salmon Don was a really good portion and is pretty much like a giant poke bowl - but no complaints. I really enjoyed it and it was super filling. Lastly, they ended up not having enough Mochi Ice Cream (kind of disappointing ) so I tried the Blueberry Creme Brulee which was pretty yummy. The space is really small so best to make a reso for larger groups, but keep in mind they don't provide split bills for groups.","Sentiment":"positive"}

There's a good variety of fish here and value wise it's very solid too. Will be returning.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Honestly a solid little spot for sushi. The atmosphere was nice and the servers were incredibly attentive! We shared the salmon lover combo and the spider roll. The spider roll was amazing and they did not skimp out on the soft shell crab. The salmon tasted fresh and the quality was quite good. The portions are decent, the price is reasonable and the food is good! Would recommend for a no fuss sushi meal in the city.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I don't usually associate Japanese food with strong flavours, but Gurume somehow is strongly tasty. My wife and I stopped by for dinner and shared the tako wasabi, aburi scallop hako, torched rainbow dragon roll, bulgogi bento and sashimi dinner (yup, we were hungry!). While we would've wanted just a bit higher quality for the price, everything was pretty good to great. Especially liked the bulgogi (perfect blend of salty sweet) and dragon roll (good torch, huge serving). Of note, the Tako wasabi was strong on the wasabi, if that's your thing. Place had a good vibe to it and the service was quick. I get why Gurume gets all the praise.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Union Social Eatery located at St. Clair and Yonge is a casual eatery serving pub style food (think burgers, hand helds, salads and some cooked dishes). They also have a selection of cheap beers, wine ,and cocktails. Perfect place for a night out with friends to catch up. The space is big and there are also TVs equipped so that you can catch your favourite sports teams. I went to this location of Union Social Eatery on a Wed night with some friends. The price for a bottle of wine was actually quite reasonable so I did get a bottle to share with one friend. My other friend opted to get her own bottle. For the food, we ordered the social club (think like a club sandwich except with grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, lettuce..all on a brioche bun). Service wise, our waitress was attentive and friendly. She came by several times during our long stay there to ask if we needed anything else. Overall, decent food, reasonable prices, good service.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We came here for lunch during Summerlicious and had a really good experience. We ate on the patio which was nice, but it's right beside the sidewalk so it's not the best. For appetizers we got the House Braised Sirloin Firecrackers, which were very tasty but strangely didn't include any braised sirloin. We also got the Candy House Salad, which was good but way too sweet, though I suppose at least the name was accurate for this one. My partner was very excited to get the Almond Crusted Chicken Tenders and I'd say they lived up to the hype. I was quite surprised by how many chicken tenders we got and they were delicious. The fries were great too. On the other hand, my BBQ Chicken Rice Bowl was a little bland and would have benefited from a garlic or chipotle sauce. Dessert was really good, we got Mars Bar Brownie and Coconut Key Lime Pie and they were both delicious. The portions were big enough we would have been happy to just share one if we weren't doing a Summerlicious menu. Overall we'd be happy to come back here again, the prices are quite reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. I'm sure we'll return next time we're craving chicken tenders.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Grilled Cajun chicken, guacamole, fried onions, lettuce, and chipotle mayo with a mountain of fries. I've had better KCS offerings, but it was still tasty and enjoyable.

{"Review Text":"It was easy to get a walk-in spot here for dinner on a Sunday. They had all the different sports games playing on TVs mounted at the middle of the restaurant above the bar. We got the shrimp tacos to start, and for the main I got the blackened chicken bow ties and my companion got the chicken club with fries. The shrimp tacos were good - I quite liked the sauce that accompanied it. I do wish that the shrimp had a bit more color - it would have looked more appetizing if it had a bit of char. The chicken club was a fairly small size, and the fries were strangely grey and the pieces were a little too small. The chicken bow tie was delicious and had lots of vegetables but still pretty heavy. You can see that there's actually a pool of liquid and oil at the bottom of the dish. Overall the food was kind of mediocre for the price. It wasn't terrible overall but definitely not a place I'll be itching to go back to.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"We were in the area on a recent Saturday afternoon and I felt a hankering for a poutine. I felt pretty confident that a place like Union Social Eatery would have a poutine on the menu, so we went inside and snagged a sweet booth near the back. And indeed, I did order the Pulled Pork Poutine (\"Aged cheddar, jalapeno-Monterey Jack, bread and butter pickles, crispy sweet onions and hand-crafted gravy\"). It arrived shortly after and it's a decent poutine. There were a few obvious problems, though. The main issue here was that the dish didn't arrive to the table hot. It had clearly been sitting around for a while, and so the whole thing was just slightly hotter than room temperature. It's not ideal. I should also note that the concoction was very, very sweet. The pulled pork had clearly been prepared with a sugar-forward barbecue sauce, while the naturally-sweet bread and butter pickles only exacerbate this feeling. It almost felt like a dessert poutine. But it's a poutine, so I enjoyed it. The plentiful cheese certainly didn't hurt, nor did the perfectly-prepared fries. I just don't know that I'd ever order it again.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I came here for lunch on a holiday and waited about half hour for a seat. We tried the signature clam intense shoyu ramen and the Asakusa tendon bowl. We really enjoyed the ramen which had a nice complex but well rounded broth. the porcini sauce and black truffle sauce didn't over power the dish which was lovely. The Asakusa tendon bowl was less impressive. it comes with ,  (salmon, Herring roe and eel) and . The tempura was rather unremarkable, it wasn't particularly light, and the default serving of it with sauce drizzled over didn't have any standout flavours so I recommend asking for more sauce. I didn't find the dish quite hot enough and rice was slightly overcooked. The piece of eel was also small, not at all like the larger pieces of tempura eel you'd find at tempura restaurants in Vancouver. They also served this way before the rest of the ramen orders arrived so I wish they had the foresight to time things accordingly so our table could eat their dishes together at once. Overall, tempura bowl is only 3* but the ramen is good and service is friendly. The space is a bit cramped and the location is not wheelchair accessible.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Got the Original Shoyu Tonkotsu Ramen Supersize for $21.  The pork is thin style. Pros: - Noodles are cooked well. - Broth is not oily and well seasoned. A nice creamy broth. Broth is not as heavy as typical ramens. - Tempura is OK. Mushroom, Yam, Pumpkin are good but broccoli was not that great. Cons: - Service is quite bad. Long wait for the actual food and to pay for the bill. - Supersize bowl isn't actually that big.  Not sure if it's worth the extra money. - Toppings are minimal (doesn't even come with an egg). - In my opinion, there's nothing too special about the ramen and tempura. It's just average.

{"Review Text":"This has become one of my favorite ramen spots when visiting the 6ix. Authentic ramen with a rich broth, fresh noodles and premium ingredients. My friends and I stopped by to sample a lil bit of everything. We shared the  wagyu shoyu, shoyu black and spicy red ramen. We also ordered some curry, Katsu don and some shrimp tempura. We all agreed the wagyu shoyu was our favorite. The bowl was packed with plenty of meat. Everything from beef bone, brisket and high quality beef meat. The black truffle sauce added some nice flavor as well. The curry is also a must order. You get a nice thick curry with a  big piece of katsu. We really enjoyed our meal here. Food is really fresh and price wise definitely reasonable right in down town. They have plenty of seating for small and large parties. Theres a lot vegetarian options as well. So glad my friends from the area recommended this spot. Despite the hot summer heat this Konjiki was so worth it.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The noodles were not what I would have expect from a world class restaurant with multiple locations all over the GTA and the world. Perhaps it's the difficulty of maintaining quality control or finding the right chef. May be I should try their other locations, but from my recollection, it wasn't mind blowing, otherwise I'd be a repeat patron.","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Chef's Hall is a nice food court with lots of different types of food to choose from, including fried chicken, Greek, Japanese, Indian, American classics, and more. I decided on Iwami for sushi. I only read the small menu posted on one of the walls and ordered one each of the cucumber maki and avocado maki; I wish I had looked at the full menu on the table(s) because they had other small and large plates to choose from. I probably would've gotten only one roll and a Beef Yaki-Udon instead. Regardless of my misunderstanding of the full menu offerings, I really enjoyed my sushi. I went with two veggie rolls because I was hungry but didn't want to feel too weighed down or full, and these were the right choice. Really fresh ingredients and friendly service. It wasn't too crowded when I visited (a Saturday afternoon during the Christmas season) and there were plenty of places to sit. I'm going to make it a point to come back in the future to try other offerings.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Finding parking is a bit tricky though. Well, isn't that the case in Downtown? Lol If you're lucky, you can find street parking, if not, you need to use underground parking which is expensive.

{"Review Text":"Chefs Hall used to be called Assembly Chef's Hall. I had heard great things about coming to this hall with lots of food stalls to choose food and drinks from. I dig Upper East Food Club and The Annex. Give me quality eateries where I can get a drink from one and a sandwich from another, and I am a happy camper. * start of aside * What confuses me here is the name change. You still see welcome mats in this hall that say Assembly. Yet, the word, Assembly, has formally disappeared in the name, along with the apostrophe. My confusion is the change from having the apostrophe removed from the name. Why? Perhaps it was misleading that it was a hall that belonged to a specific chef? It's kind of the same debate with farmers' market versus farmers market. With the former, multiple farmers run each market, so a plural possessive noun makes sense. Chefs' hall. Do multiple chefs run each hall? I don't know. With the latter, farmers market implies that markets may be supplied by multiple farmers, but they are not necessarily owned by those farmers. Chefs Hall. Chefs may not own the hall. Do they? I don't know, either. Conclusion: The name of this hall needs help. I'd call it Hall of Yumminess. * end of aside * I live under a rock. For years, when I am attending a concert or some event at Scotiabank Arena, or I'm in the vicinity as a tourist, I park at Richmond Adelaide Centre. I didn't realize that I was always a three-minute walk away from Chefs Hall. It's probably because I'm never hungry going to Scotiabank Arena. After the event is over, I want to walk back to fetch my car and head home. It was straightforward walking over to Chefs Hall from this parking lot. There were signs that guided me over. Chefs Hall is divided into three halls: - Beer Hall (it's closest to Adelaide, with a bar and a stage) - Vendor Hall (it's where all the food stalls are) - Main Hall (there's a larger bar and a patio area) I liked how I felt walking through the Beer Hall. It was cozy with plants everywhere. There were lots of places to sit down, have a drink, and eat either with a group or by yourself. I needed the woman's washroom when I got here. I found it almost immediately when I walked up the stairs to the Vendor Hall. I was thrilled. It was clean and nicely maintained. There are steps up to all food stalls. As far as accessibility goes, there are a couple of accessibility lifts in the Beer Hall and Main Hall. They look like cubes. I have been here for an event in the Main Hall. If you have an event, you can rent a hall. It gets blocked off, so others will know that they can't crash your event. This hall was roomy and fabulous. I have also dropped by Oswald's Pizza to grab some Detroit-style pizza. I loved my food. When I was there, I got a glimpse of these food vendors: - Oswald's Pizza - Grandma Loves You - Charcoal Biriyani - Hawaiian Poke Bar - The Red Eye Should I be downtown for a concert and haven't eaten, I'd come here to grab a bite beforehand. Chefs Hall is open Mondays and Tuesdays from . Wednesdays through Saturdays, hours are from . It's closed on Sundays. There is free wifi. What was weird was that it prompted for my e-mail address and birthdate, including year of birth. No free wifi needs that personal information to connect, so I declined using it. I look forward to returning to try other food stalls. It's a cool place and concept. (163)","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I like the concept of Chefs Hall, as it is an upscale food court providing dining options from restaurant level vendors. Recently came for dinner, and tried two of the restaurants. At Grateful Chicken, we ordered the classic fried chicken sandwich combo with buttermilk onion rings and a cream soda. The sandwich was good, freshly fried crunchy chicken in a soft potato bun. The onion rings were thick and crispy but lacking in salt, so it was not as good as could be. At Charcoal Biryani, we ordered the spicy lamb biryani bowl on the recommendation of the vendor. The lamb itself was super tender, and the bowl had plenty of rice, cashews, and seasoning. However, this was also lacking salt so it was bland and definitely not spicy I don't know why every dish was lacking flavor or salt. Maybe catering to the general crowd? Not for me.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Overly sweet for me so don't think I would order that again. As for the pancakes - really awesome presentation. However, I found the taste was mediocre. The matcha sauce was average but the pancakes were really heavy and rich with the whipped cream on top. Had I known there was going to be whipped cream I would have asked to opt out.

{"Review Text":"Edulis doesn't need my review...or yours. This quaint little home (once a worker's cottage?!) on Niagara Street offers a Michelin-level dining experience, superb authentically Canadian seafood tasting menu, in a warm and intimate environment. There are only two chefs (the owners, who opened Edulis about a decade ago, after building their respective careers in other fine dining establishments) and  (who appear knowledgable and passionate about Edulis and it's offerings). The capacity is about , and there is only one sitting per evening. That's right, my fellow slow eaters can savour their meal in peace. They want you to stay awhile and enjoy the meal (and the company of your dining companion!) Now, on to the food. Oh my goodness. If this restaurant doesn't get at least one Michelin star, it will be a crime. And we Canadians should take it as a personal offense. The 7-course tasting menu featured seafood from all across . We had fish from both coasts, as well as Nunavut. We also had caviar, crab, and lobster. The pairings were savoury and divine. My favourite dish featured fresh little mushrooms from Saskatchewan (picked at the beginning of the season), and sweet corn (from Ontario, I believe). Every course is so deliberate, both in flavour and in presentation. No detail spared. I almost feel sorry for eating it. We added two additional dishes to our very filling tasting courses: aged cured Jamon from Spain, and a platter of . The jamon was aged . The perfect amount of firmness, saltiness, and a delectable little snack to pique our interest for what was yet to come. The cheeses complemented each other perfectly. We enjoyed a thoughtful mix of firm and soft cheeses for dessert. If you have a special occasion or just enjoy a good tasting menu, get on the waitlist for a reservation here.

Served with a Marcona almond pur\u00e9e and the first rapini of the season (including its buds), this was simplicit\u00e9at its best. Smokiness from the Marcona almonds punched up the dish and balanced the saltiness of the crab meat. One of the downfalls of many chefs is overcomplicating dishes with numerous ingredients. This was thoughtful in presentation and taste. Pour le prochain plat, an earthy dish consisting of Nova Scotia lobster and porcini mushrooms. The decorative circles of demi-glace drew my eyes into the mound of perfection. The mushrooms had been intricately brunoised and mixed with luscious, buttery chunks of lobster. While these two ingredients are not a common pairing, the earthiness of the wild mushrooms emphasized the sweetness of the succulent seafood. A noticeable lull occurred at this point in the repas, with a long stretch between courses. We migrated from shellfish to fish with Chinook salmon in a shallow pool of dashi broth. What surprised me about the salmon was its unusual ivory flesh -- an apparent result of its diet -- and insipid flavour. Earthy new potatoes and green asparagus accompanied the salmon, but didn't add anything to the dish's overall blandness. A pile of poorly chopped herbs covered the whole dish and wasn't a purposeful treatment to garnish this Asian-inspired dish....\"","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"We'd been trying to make our way to Edulis for what felt like years, but for some reason the timing just never worked out. I finally managed to make a reservation for a date that turned out to be right in the midst of the whole Coronavirus thing, with our reservation on one of the restaurant's final nights before it closed (temporarily, one would hope). Anyway, we showed up right on time and were shown to a cozy table right by the bar. It was impressively private for about half hour meal, after which point another couple was seated at a table about eight inches away from us. It was annoying, but expected. We decided to start with the plate of hand-sliced Jamon Joselito Gran Reserva ham, which was served with four small house-made breadsticks. It's definitely quite impressive. Imagine the very best prosciutto you've ever had and then multiply that by a million times, and you have the taste of this stuff. It really was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Now, do I feel like it was worth fifty bucks? No, not really. But the reason we came was to chow down on the joint's $. I wish I could describe each course individually, but Edulis doesn't provide a menu of the evening's dishes. What I can say is that we enjoyed every course quite a lot, including the delicious bread and butter that kicked off the whole thing. I was impressed, too, that said bread and butter was refilled once during the course of the evening. The bread came in handy when it came time to sop up the various sauces included in certain dishes. The theme of the evening was seafood, as the lion's share of the courses contained some kind of seafood component. The complexity in these dishes was nothing short of incredible, as the food had been meticulously prepared and served - but it was in the often jaw-dropping flavors that Edulis shined. A seemingly simple dish - one course involved two scallops served in the shell, for example - had been layered with ingredients that enhanced and elevated it to an astonishing extent. (It did make us wish the portions were bigger, of course, although by the time the meal ended, we were quite full.) The meal was capped off with a pair of pretty phenomenal desserts, including some kind of cake that had been soaked in a rum sauce and served with a small pot of chantilly cream. It was excessive and decadent and we loved it. I want to note, also, that our server was amazing. He was super helpful and took the time to explain each of our dishes. (I wasn't crazy about the enormous wait time between courses, though. You would imagine 15, , but we wound up waiting well over a half hour for certain courses, which meant the meal took over three hours to eat. It was a bit much.)","Sentiment":"positive"}

We had the chips\/guac\/mild salsa, the elotes (I forgot to ask for it off the cob but it was still awesome), and we split the poblano with pickled onion tacos.  The tacos were sneaky spicy (in a great way) so beware!   And the star of the show:  the gluten free churros with dulce de leche sauce.  Wowie, so amazing!  It was worth the trip just for that dessert.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The pollo frito (fried chicken) was incredible, the mixed mushroom starter was yummy, and the poblano tacos and black bean tacos - delicious. Even gluten free churros omg. There were only the two vegetarian taco options but honestly you don't need more (my husband is the chicken-eater). Lovely patio, if a bit crowded. Service is a bit slow because the kitchen is tiny, but not slow enough to complain. Will definitely be back!","Sentiment":"positive"}

Service: 4\/5 - Server was nice and didn't rush me. Made some nice recommendations. Notes: Interior is pretty casual, I would only go for patio. Resos are recommended. Good for casual lunch\/dinner with friends or dates but not for coworkers. Please note washroom is downstairs if mobility is an issue.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"El Pocho Antojitos Bar was absolutely not on my radar, but I'm always interested in checking out a new place, so I jumped at the chance to give the place a shot on a recent Sunday morning. We arrived at around 11:. It was a sunny day but a little cool, so the covered patio was just about perfect. I had looked at the menu online and figured I'd order some tacos, but I discovered that they had a bunch of brunch options, including a dish called something like Carne Asada Breakfast Fries. (The brunch menu is bizarrely nowhere to be found online, so I can't tell you exactly what it was called or what was in it.) The dish arrived about . It's a mound of french fries topped with carne asada meat, caramelized onions, a spicy aioli of some kind, and two sunnyside up eggs. This is one hell of a delicious concoction. Everything works ridiculously well together and the various components are just about perfect in terms of execution and presentation. The carne asada is super tender and irresistibly smoky, while the other elements are equally delicious and well thought-out. I honestly can't remember a brunch dish I've enjoyed more. The service was great, too. I'll absolutely be returning in the future, though it'll be difficult not to just order this every single time.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Went here for lunch today. We left feeling disappointed. A 12\" primavera pizza was ordered with chicken added and another 12\" off their Winter Special menu with roasted kale and roasted beet (Vendura Arrostita Pizza), again with chicken added. On the last pizza I swapped the Bianco sauce for a traditional tomato based. The primavera: Back when this pizza was tried the first time it was remembered to have chicken chunks, beautifully roasted. The change that was seen today, chicken cubes- certainly not the same quality as before. The artichoke \"hearts\" that used to be a signature of this pizza has also gotten swapped for simple small pieces of artichoke leaves, close to the heart yet not quite that good meaty center of the 'choke, lets face it, we artichoke lovers, CRAVE, love, & need to have when there is an artichoke heart on the menu! And that crumbled parmesan cheese they claim is parm being sprinkled on the pizza from the shaker... yeah that DID NOT taste at all like parmesan cheese. Instead they should offer flakes of parmesan chips. Mmm that would be a mighty topping for sure. I get that these changes may have been made due to managing a business and needed to budget accordingly.  Things cant be expected to stay the same forever, yet when something is tried, tested and delicious, effort needs to be met to keep that standard high. The olives on the other hand, out of this entire primavera option was substantial, they were not stingy on them and that was nice. As for my pizza, the one with the kale. It was tasty. I said it was more like a salad on a pizza, than a traditional pizza, which is what I truly desired. Frankly, given my experience, I will be sure to listen to my gut the next time. I should've just ordered the margherita! The kale pizza was missing its \"wow\" factor for me. Like, it was on the bland side. It was good but needed something to give it some zazz! All in all, each 12\" pizza came out to about $. When I was looking forward to pizza, even treating ourselves and going out for lunch after a long time of not doing so, to be met with this experience falling short, was such a let down. We will not be returning to Famoso, especially when it was once a favourite! P.S Dean is an awesome manager, perhaps when he reads this things might change for the better.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Famoso pizza is great. It is thin on the bottom with a tasty chewy crust. The 12\" is more than enough for two persons. They have great happy hour special prices on drinks and every evening a few discounted drinks all night. The sangria is good, a little sweet but I loved the blueberries, raspberries.  And blackberries. The peach salad with Gorgonzola and nuts is refreshing, and crisp lettuce. They have a nice patio but no heaters (at least not in early September). Highly recommend to dine here.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"It's a nice place with inexpensive but large pizzas, everyday special discounted items including good $, and Monday through Thursday really good other specials. Also the small 7\" pizza with salad combo can't be beat. Also the wait staff are efficient and very nice. The only problem is the food is blah. Meaning bland. I think the marinara sauce is missing some oregano, missing garlic or something. The pizza dough under the toppings gets soggy fast so it's like mush pizza. The dry part of the crust is good with a little char, I don't understand why the rest is soggy. Maybe it sat too long. Usually pizza is served a little hotter. But the caprese salad also was bland. It looked nice, but the mozzarella cheese was bland and the dressing ok, but also a little nothing special. The tomatoes were nice, but I think we're just ordinary tomatoes. The pasta meatball antica presentation was great. The sauce was like the pizza sauce, ok, not special. I think the sauce is from a can that is simple and also served to elementary school children. I had a $. I liked it because it was not sweet. But many people won't like because it is not sweet. It also was nit strong at only 1% of booze. Yeah I'm picky, but that's how I am. I may return.

Remembering how good the food was, I decided it would be best for me to come out here three years later to see if the place had changed in any way or if it was still the same place I remembered it to be. This place is still rocking!  I ordered a Caesar Salad along with a Lasagna for myself.  I do not remember what my friend ordered.  The service was friendly, professional and quick.  The food came out quite quickly which is especially good for those who may be in a rush.  The food tasted quite fresh, which is always a good thing. I hear that the pizza here is great, but I was not in the mood for pizza when I was here.  I'll have to try that next time, reading what the other reviews are saying. The only reason why this place is being rated .  I get it - this place is near Yorkville, but still, I think the prices could be a bit less.  Other than that, this place is great and I'll definitely be back here again in the future.","Sentiment":"positive"}

It's been years and the taste is as good as ever. Kimchi fries' served warm smothered under pulled pork, fresh kimchi, scallions, mayo. The huge box is huge as a perfect lunch fill-up or late night snack. Add jalape\u00f1o as I did if you like a bit of extra heat. The Boys' banh mi is nothing to scoff at either: it's among the best in the city! . This time, I opted for grilled pork.

This would normally be no big deal but it's constant and I literally had to eat the taco in a bowl. The amount of cabbage and carrots that go in the taco is extreme!

{"Review Text":"Eating here always gives me a sense of nostalgia as they have kept their menu and prices the same for almost a decade. They are the perfect no-frill eatery if you are looking for a hot home-cooked meal that will fill you up without breaking the bank. Almost all their dishes are under $10, with some udon and snacks listed for under $5. My go-to usually consists of takoyaki and the curry udon (6.99). To mix things up, I ordered the hotate rice (scallop with egg, scallions and mayo). The nori and furikake seasoning paired with kewpie mayo is always great, but otherwise nothing fancy about the dish. The takoyaki was quite doughy compared to when I had it previously, but great portion for the price. Stepping into the space, the homey interior gives you a feel of dining in a mom & pop shop in Japan. Service is generally quick with the number of customers they are serving. Don't let the fact that it is hidden away in the Grange disuade you from giving this place a try!","Sentiment":"positive"}

What I got: - Takoyaki - Tofu Nuggets - Kitsune Udon Final Thoughts: I haven't been to Manpuku in years and I'm quite honestly torn as the price is still unbeatable (the whole meal cost me about $15), but the quality is not what I remember from years ago. I bit into an empty takoyaki and after biting all of them in half I found only 2\/. The octopus that was present was so small I almost missed it which was incredibly disappointing. I hope this was just a one-off. The udon is nothing special, but for the price it's a great cheap meal. The tofu nuggets had edamame in them and were topped with a tangy sauce. The server helping me was also incredibly sweet. I'd come back for the price when I'm in need of a quick bite, but if you're looking quality it may be worth spending a little more elsewhere.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I would have loved it if it had a bit of soup, but you can't complain for $7. If you've never tried natto, FYI it's quite slimey and may not be the best fit dor you if you're picky about texture. If you're in the neighbourhood and need a quick meal for a very fair price, would definitely recommend. There may be a wait, but generally the service is efficient enough that things no I've along quickly.

{"Review Text":"Was looking for a meal nearby the AGO and discovered this spot! Tucked inside the Village of the Grange food court, this spot was like a casual cafeteria. We ordered the takoyaki for appetizer and black sesame cake for dessert. For mains, we ordered shigure don (sliced beef on rice), hotate rice (scallop with egg and scallion on rice) and beef udon to share. The shigure don was delicious! Very saucy (so keep that in mind if you don't like your rice on the wet side). The hotate rice was like a fried omelette on rice. My favourite was the beef udon. Noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth was light. The takoyaki was a bit doughy and wasn't crispy enough. As for the black sesame cake, it had a slightly hard texture so not sure if it was just not as fresh or frozen. All in all, everything was priced cheap, so you'll definitely leave with a full stomach without emptying your wallet too much! I would come back again to try the other udon.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Sadly they were out of the yakitori don. - Chawanmushi ($4.25) - came out hot but a little underwhelming flavour wise. - Tsukimi udon ($5.49) - fish cakes were good but the broth was plain and lacked depth. - Curry udon ($6.99) - this was my favourite bowl. Good curry flavour and great portion. - Manpuku ramen ($7.99) - broth is a chicken soy sauce base, which was surprisingly decent. Same goes for the tender pork belly. Noodles were mediocre but that was expected. - Negitama gyudon ($8.99) - Hotate rice ($8.99) - this was omelette style. Perfect spot for a filling, cheap meal.

The veggies inside the banh mi are quite good. The meat quality can vary however. Sometimes you get meat that's super tender and cooked just right inside your baguette. Other times, you'll get a meat that is way overcooked or underdone and you end up having to spit out some gnarly pieces cuz they aren't chewable. The tacos are definitely not worth it. The tortillas dnt have the right texture and they're a lil stingy on the filling for each one. I'd say save your money for a banh mi or kimchi fries. I've also heard that you can have a different food experience depending on which location you go to (apparently there's high schoolers or uni students cooking your food at one of the locations?).

Grilled flavor was non existent with chicken only slathered in salty sauce. Bread was not as fresh crispy as it should have been.

The portions are a good size -- I was very full after eating the fries alone. I know kalbi is obviously not a traditional banh mi ingredient, but being Korean I thought it was fun that they included it as a fusion flavor. It didn't taste like Korean kalbi at all, though, and I thought the sandwich just fell flat. I've had a few banh mi at other places that had more flavor and just seemed fresher. The Kimchi Fries were good fries but if you are looking for a good kimchi flavor, you won't get it. There was barely any kimchi and the few pieces were watered down and not spicy at all. It had scallions, pulled pork, and mayo as well. A yummy \"loaded\" fries, but not really kimchi or Korean flavored. The food was good, just wasn't outstanding as I was expecting it to be. I'd be willing to come back to try other banh mi options, though.","Sentiment":"positive"}

However, I don't think I would go back on a regular basis anymore given that it's evolved into generic fast food quality.","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Banh Mi Boys was a regular part of my diet throughout University and I still thoroughly enjoy eating here. I always get the classics: Kimchi Fries and Fried Chicken Steamed Bao's. The Kimchi Fries ($9.50) include mayo, spicy Asian BBQ pulled pork (not too much kick), green onions, and, of course, kimchi. I love the hot fries with the cold mayo on top and the pulled pork tastes amazing. It's a great dish that hits the spot, but sometimes I grab some Fried Chicken Steamed Bao's for the side. The Fried Chicken Steamed Bao's ($5.50) are juicy and crunchy. The sauce, fried chicken, bun, and vegetables all taste great - it's such a satisfying snack. The bun is a tad plastic-y at Banh Mi Boys in relation to something like Momofuku in which their outer is just soft and doughy. Extremely minor nitpick though. I've had the actual Banh Mi sandwiches before as well, but they're not my go-to. I used to grab the Bao's for under $3. $6. $7, so it breaks my heart a bit that there have been consistent price increases here, but it's just a sign of the times. What used to cost $ $20, so the ratio of food portion size to price is getting wider. The locations are simple and fast. Seating on the side at the front and the kitchen in the back. Good place to takeaway or grab a quick seat and scarf it down. Always clean and staff are friendly and efficient.","Sentiment":"positive"}

There was quite a wait between the appetizer and the arrival of the main course. I had the Agnolotti and bf got the Carbonara. Again, beautiful presentation.

The sausage was pretty tasty but the absolute standout of this dish was the polenta cream (soooo smooth). - Cavoletti Fritti: The brussel sprouts were a bit limp. But the truffle dressing and shaved parmigiano reggiano they were bathed in was a show stopper. - Carbonara: The pasta Ascari is most known for. Don't quite get the fuss. It was nice and creamy, good amount of cheese, a bit overly salty (if it was a blind taste test, I would've thought I was having squid ink noodles). Good, not exceptional. - Seafood Risotto: Pricey but worth it. Rice was firm yet creamy. Good amount of seafood, especially the milky piece of halibut at the centre. - Pistachio Tart: The food was good, but this was the star of the meal for me. A really creative tasting dessert, with the red wine poached pear and pistachio cutting through all the creaminess we just had for dinner. Overall service was good - great recommendations, quick to fill up water, attentive nut not intrusive. Place itself was casual chic. I can see why people like going here.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Packed on a Monday evening! Pasta made in house is a dream. Salads were a standout - the burrata was unique and the arugula so yummy. The hazelnut semi freddo was a perfect ending, not too sweet, very nutty. Wine list typical, perhaps a bit overpriced. I'd like to come back and try brunch!","Sentiment":"positive"}

The food is consistently good, love the seasonal variations, love the curated wine list.  The service is always warm and friendly.

{"Review Text":"My friends took me here to celebrate my birthday and the food was on point. Every dish and plate was flavourful and satisfying. We tried esch other's pastas and all of them amazing in their own respective ways. We were tempted to order another plate of pasta to share as our dessert. It did get busy so make reservations. One thing to look out for, it is a small place and we went in the evening and it is getting cold at night. When folks were leaving or entering, if both sets of doors were open, it got a tad cold. Personally, worth it, but heads up. Otherwise, try this place out is my recommendation.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Magical Italian pasta joint in Leslieville! Good wine selection from sweet to dry and some in betweens, but the claim to fame is the handmade pasta and quick service! The arancini balls are super soft and packed with risotto flavour also topped with melted pecorino cheese. The agnoloti di limone has a great rich ricotta center balanced with the bitter fava beans and lemon juice. Also tried the trofie a funghi (mushroom) and the pappardelle alla guancia di manzo (beef cheek) pasta and was solidly impressed. The beefiness soaked right into the thick and broad pappardelle noodle. Handmade does make a difference! Prepare to spend at least $, however, trying a bunch of their plates and sharing is definitely the way to go!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This was my first time going to an Armenian restaurant, so my standards have been set exceptionally high! Our waiter was personable. From the moment we sat down, he explained to us the history behind the restaurant and its Armenian culture. I have never had mante before, but the idea of Armenian dumplings with yogurt, mint, and sumac sounded divine. It basically tasted like kabob dumplings in a creamy Mediterranean yogurt. Simple, yet exquisite. We also ordered the Karnoug. These lamb chops were cooked perfectly and marinated with charmoula. The labneh and shishito peppers added a nice touch to this dish. For a side, we ordered the batata hara. These potatoes were a bit bland as we were hoping for a fully zaatar seasoned potato. The yogurt br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert was a perfect way to redefine a popular French dessert with an Armenian twist.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Have lived in the neighborhood for many years but never got around to trying Mayrik until now. I don't think we have been missing much. Firstly the service was not very attentive. There were three total tables when we sat down and one table was soon having dessert and then gone leaving only two tables including ours. Still the food was very slow to arrive including a salad that required no cooking and a steak done rare that couldn't have taken more than five minutes. (More on this later). What we had: fatoush salad -- pretty good, whole sea bass butterflied and deboned expertly -- very good, ribeye steak ordered medium rare but arrived rare. We didn't send it back because we were so hungry from waiting and both of us were ok with rare although our preference would've been another minute on the grill. And four whole peppers seasoned and roasted on the grill. The peppers were tasty but one of them was a little suspect with some graying and \"bruising\" in parts indicating it wasn't as fresh as it should be. We didn't take our chances with that one. Also a bit nit picky here but for the price we paid would it be too much to ask you to core the peppers so we don't spend all that time picking out the seeds? The rib eye was a good size and quality but a vein of gristle rendered part of it inedible. And there was the matter of doneness as noted above. The fish was the highlight of the meal lightly seasoned and perfectly cooked. All dishes were enough for two to share. Not sure what you'd do if you had four. One last bone to pick. The rib eye was a special it was $65, a full $20+ higher than the NY strip loin on the regular menu. Waitress didn't note the price difference I assumed it would be +$. Total meal for two was about $. No drinks just tap water. Not worth it.","Sentiment":"positive"}

However, I will not be coming back and this is simply because this is the only restaurant I've been to that forces you to order side dishes with your main. I eat at plenty of fancy restaurants and I don't see this anywhere else. For $34, I expect at least some vegetables with my grilled seabass - not just a piece of lemon. The irony, of course, is that if you order off their takeout menu, all of your side dishes are included.","Sentiment":"negative"}

There were empty tables on the patio and we asked the server to seat us at one of them. He responded that we'd have to speak to the manager.

But my first experience with Mayrik was through delivery, and it actually made me appreciate the food without all the glitz: - The octopus was wrapped in green leaf and bathed in this buttery sauce that just accentuated the milky sweetness of the meat. This was easily my favourite dish. - The roasted cauliflower had this really tasty dressing, which was great but would have liked more of it. Oh so close to being otherworldly! - The muhhamara had a good kick to it, though would have preferred a bit more walnuts. - The pita bread was fat and dense, almost like pizza dough. If this is what Mayrik tastes like when it's not at its best, sign me up for more!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Burgernator is conveniently located in Kensington market, one of my fave places to browse for new eats and unique shopping goods. Burgernator was one of my first tries at gourmet burgers and now that I've had a lot more under my belt, I don't feel like the burgers here are memorable or stand out to me. I ordered the meat burger, the bulldozer, while my friend ordered the veggie burger, ak-veggie 7. The bulldozer is a lean lamb patty burger topped with havarti cheese, fresh mango salsa, saut\u00e9ed jalape\u00f1os, and chipotle aioli. The Ak-veggie , caramelized onions, homemade guacamole, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. Unfortunately, although the toppings sounded delicious on paper, the burgers themselves tasted underwhelming. They were decent burgers but the patties weren't as juicy and the toppings did not add as much flavour as anticipated. I don't think it hurts to try Burgernator as a burger lover because as I said, the burgers are decent, but I don't think I'd be down to give it another go given how average my first experience was and how many other amazing burger places there are.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Also someone else ordered the same thing and then theirs came out the top gun was open and they carefully drizzled the jerk sauce in a nice pattern on top. By mine was thrown together by a toddler.

{"Review Text":"In a city sprawling with fantastic burger restaurants, I had passed by The Burgernator in Kensington Market many times, always curious given the name and eclectic names of their signature burgers. On a mission to find the best burgers in the city, I finally gave them a try and was certainly not disappointed. I clearly ordered more than I should have (but, to be clear, ate every last bite) and went with The Baconator Burger (with two beef patties, beef bacon, a garlic aioli sauce and the fixings), the Burgernator Fries (yummy fries with beef chilli cheese, chives and sour cream) and a chocolate shake. Please don't judge me; I don't think I ate anything else for the rest of the day. Despite all the fixings, every part of the burger fit perfectly together and the meat was very well cooked. My complaint had been the quality of the bun as it was a little hard and not as fresh as I would have liked. This is a large, meaty and indulgent burger and one that could easily fill you up. The Burgernator fries were very cheesy (in a good way) and the beef chilli added a nice touch. The milkshake was authentic; you can tell real ice cream had been blended in instead of some artificial mix. Alas, if you're craving a meaty, fresh and original burger, The Burgernator should definitely be a place you should consider trying. With a variety of interest sides and shakes, you'll have many exciting choices to choose from depending on how hungry you are. This is a pre-COVID review and logistically, everything was very efficiently run and pleasant. You make your order, take a seat and they tell you when your food is ready.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":", minus . Came here to try our luck after having been told there were no seats left at The Oxley, and one of the servers were able to find us a table given that we can finish in an hour's time. We shared the charcuterie plate and the Cosimo pizza, which was just the right amount of food. My friend had a glass of red, the Primitivo I Muri, while I decided to try one of their Italian beers. I definitely will get the red wine next time - the beer selection was scarce and the lager I ordered had a grassy taste to it. Not very befitting with pizza and deli meats and cheeses. The Cosimo pizza was definitely the highlight of the meal, but the table bread and their infused olive oil really blew me away till the end of our meal. First, the pizza. It was light, it was airy, like chewying a cloud, and the crust melted in my mouth without me having to chew for long. The truffle oil complemented and was not overpowering, and the soppressata was like a smoky chorizo paste that wasnt salty at all. Now onto the olive oil! I think it had dried hot peppers, bay leaves, whole peppercorns, and rosemary sprigs. I poured a more than generous amount in my plate and used the bread to eat it like soup. The scent of fresh bread with aromatic olive oil really opened up my palate...which was why I looked up with confusion and disappointment when my olive oil plate was whisked away from under my air suspended bread, ready for continous dipping. The server explained that they were making room for the pizza, and that they will bring the olive oil and bread basket back again later. But they didn't!! Even though my palate fully enjoyed the pizza, my mind was thinking about when they could bring back the bread and the olive oil. Update - Aug 9th 2023: I visited Dimmi's three more times since my first review, and each time the bread\/olive oil and the Cosmo pizza continued to amaze me. It's nice that they're consistent :)","Sentiment":"positive"}

In general the service was quite good but in my mind they dropped the ball when the server did not comment on our not eaten Nutella cheesecake (two little nibbles).

I love when they serve bread on the house The calamari was amazing, definitely how I like it and not the way other chain restaurants make it. The pasta was soooo good and they definitely didn't hold out on the seafood. We came with a party of 't allow splitting the bill, however if you do the math yourself and break down the bill... the server can charge you accordingly on the machine. Haha. Guess it's an honour system at that point because she didn't double check my calculations but she's lucky we do this all the time","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Overall a solid spot, and reasonably casual compared to most of the surrounding restaurants. We came here for dinner, and the waitress was very helpful and did a great job. Food was solid, everything was good but probably not going to blow you away. For the price, it was fine. I got the gnocchi which was good, especially the rose sauce, and the rigatoni in vodka sauce was the table favourite. The tiramisu was solid too; only thing I didn't love was that the bread was served cold. The service didn't feel particularly rushed, but the servers were a bit too eager to take our plates away, continually coming back before we were done, which was a bit much. Otherwise it was a solid Italian spot with a good menu, especially the half bottles of wine. Not sure I would be too eager to come back, but it's a solid backup spot if everything else around is booked up and you need to get your pasta fix.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"They are known for their Southern Italian cuisine and comfortable atmosphere. The menu is quite large and they have anything you'd want for Italian food. Starting off with the appys, we tried: 1. Calamari Fritti 2. Burrata 3. Steamed Mussels We found the calamari to be lightly battered and fried. It came with a side of cocktail sauce, and was a good sharing dish. The Burrata was definitely our favourite appy, per usual. It came with arugula on the bottom, with balsamic, cherry tomatoes and olive oil on top. We are huge Burrata lovers, and this dish did not disappoint!! The steamed mussels were also quite delicious, and came marinated in a spicy marinara sauce. We enjoyed dipping our table bread into the sauce, and wish we could have more. Moving on to the entrees, we had: 1. Linguini with clams 2. Fusilli con pollo 3. Strozzapreti alla Ernesto The linguini with clams was a white sauce pasta made with white wine, garlic and olive oil. To be honest, we felt this dish lacked flavour and we weren't too impressed with it. The fusilli con pollo came with a pesto cream sauce, mixed with mushrooms and chicken. We liked this pasta the most out of the three, and thought it was a good balance of flavours. The strozzapreti alla Ernesto was a red sauce pasta with spicy nduja sausages, rapini, cherry tomatoes mixed in a garlic and olive oil. This dish was decent, and the flavouring was there, but we still felt like it missed something. For dessert we tried their tiramisu, and it was delicious!! It has a nice coffee flavour and was super light and fluffy. We would definitely come back for the dessert!!","Sentiment":"positive"}

All the ingredients were fresh and the condiments stand had very interesting ingredients to add, although I wish there was a better explanation as to what they were.

{"Review Text":"Understaffed. The staff there (I think there were only ) tried their best, but it still ended up being a bit of a mess. Firstly, there was no one greeting me at the door, so I could theoretically have walked right in to join my friends without having my vaccination receipt checked. In addition, there was a QR code you had to scan which linked to a website where you input your information for contact tracing purposes - however, the paper with the code was stuck inconspicuously on a side wall and no one pointed it out to my attention. So I imagine there were quite a few people who had no idea it was there. Then, the menu had several items which were unavailable (enoki mushrooms, crown daisy, etc. were crossed out). We had to gesture several times to get our order sheets picked up. On the first order, none of the orders came in the correct portions - for example, we would put in  () only to end up getting . The second time we explicitly asked the waitress to make sure we received everything, and finally did. The food itself was quite fresh, and the various hotpot broths were delicious as well - I had the variety mushroom broth, which was a fragrant, aromatic base with a surprisingly rich flavour. While service was very slow and inattentive, we were not rushed despite the supposed 2-hour limit (the fact that we went at 2PM probably helped). The sauces were self-serve and plentiful in variety. I was also rather pleased that the washrooms were impeccably clean.

{"Review Text":"This all you can eat Chinese hotpot place really hits the spot. Everyone gets their own pot. Sadly all the soups are chargeable (effectively making it a compulsory surcharge on top of the base price). I tried 3. Legendary spicy - least spicy (half mild) was still quite spicy but was otherwise alright.\u00a0Tomato (non spicy) was very tasty though it was on the sour side. Corn & sweet potato was very tasty. Ultimately all the stocks use the same master broth (which you get when you top up your pot). The dipping sauces were decent. Due to covid, they're currently mixed for you by the staff. Superior chef's recommendation & authentic Cantonese dipping were a bit salty. The choice of hotpot ingredients was wide & their quality pretty good; portions are indicated & small, making portion control easy. Especially tasty were fried pork rib & simmered pork intestines (firm, very tasty). New Zealand lamb & AAA Angus beef were good too. Pork blood was bouncy (like firm tofu). Popcorn chicken was pretty good & legendary pork slice was ok. The only partial disappointment was the beef balls: a bit inconsistent - many were very bouncy but some were too soft. For a hotpot place, the desserts were surprisingly good. The ice cream was surprisingly good & tiny, making trying all the desserts easy. Ice jelly was very smooth (brown sugar wa better than peppermint). Fried golden bread came with condensed milk - mmm. Crispy taro was pretty good - a fried taro ring with sweet taro paste inside (unfortunately there wasn't enough paste). On the down side the tang yuan (rice ball soup) was rather bland. The balls were small and so couldn't be stuffed. Unfortunately the service was a bit lacking. I was in a group of 9, split into . Our orders kept going to the wrong table. I certainly intend to come back to try more of the soup bases and have more hotpot!","Sentiment":"positive"}

The table of sauces and garnishes was appreciated to add flavour to the meal. The meat quality was very good- I liked the lamb, beef, shrimp, and dumplings. The mussels were also very good but some better than others. The medium spicy level was very hot and I was sweating after a while, although I was hoping the flavour would seem in some more. Leaving many meats relatively flavourless unless you scooped some broth to chase the bite with. I wish there was a guide for how long you are supposed to cook everything? I found I was overcooking many things just so that I wasn't making myself sick. Help! I'm a hot pot rookie. Overall good value for all you can eat- but no I probably wont go out of my way to return.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Came here for the Lunch Special \"Super Legendary Combo\" which includes , , , and . ME: Corn and potato cream soup, pork loin, crab sticks, lobster bad, and quail egg, taro, kelp knots, handmade tofu and frozen tofu, ramen. Great price for one person, a really hefty serving. Don't forget to go to the sauce bar and make your own dipping sauce. I didn't use much of that however. Didn't think the pork loin was very good, nor were the ingredients, rather they come from an AYCE style situation so of course it's not going to be upscale quality stuff. But I enjoyed my hot pot. I wasn't boiled over (pun intended). My broth came with corn and some random sweet potatoes as well. Service was pretty good, they were really nice people.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I have been going to Hemingway's for . A great spot for a drink on the upstairs patio, winter or summer. It seems like nothing has changed. I wouldn't come here for innovative bar food, but as a night out with friends or a spot for drinks after work, there's nowhere better in the neighbourhood.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I first went there for Taylor Swift trivia, which was quite lively! Great atmosphere, greasy hosts, great special drinks menu. I've also been once on the rooftop patio, which is a lovely experience. But I also once stopped by with friends looking for a place to drink and chat, and it ended up being quite unsuited - crowded, rowdy, very loud music downstairs. If you can't find a spot on the rooftop, it might not be worth it.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"First off, location is great for this restaurant. The lamb burger was okay. The meat was over cooked and dry. The lamb tacos were also okay but once again the meat was over cooked and dry. Grilled Salmon Salad was good. Pavlova was overly sweet and could use some more fruit. Service was alright and outdoor seating was good. Probably wouldn't return to this restaurant. I find it overrated.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We came here for dinner before heading out to Nuit Blanche. We ordered the steak and New Zealand lamb. The steak was okay. There wasn't anything wrong with it; just basic. No real wow factor. The lamb was amazing. It came with roasted root vegetables (some were a bit undercooked), mashed potatoes and the lamb had mint gravy on top and that was the star of the dish. The hints of mint really gave the gravy a good, welcomed kick. Honestly, I would've liked more gravy to have with my mashed! The total came to be around $60-$70 (we also ordered a beer) which is expensive BUT it's downtown price. Give the quality and location, this was a very reasonable price. Speaking of the atmosphere, we went around 7pm and sat inside. I know that this place does get busier throughout the night. When we were there, it had a more restaurant vibe than a pub. I'm sure later in the night it would get louder and more lively. So depending what vibe your looking for, keep that in mind!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This isn't necessarily a hidden gem in the heart of Yorkville but for its price range and the deliciousness of its meals, it certainly is a gem of sorts! We were lucky to have made a reservation the day before as there was a long line up by 5:30pm and the first floor\/bar area seemed already jam packed. We were immediately seated on the rooftop patio by the TV and edge of the roof so it certainly felt more spacious than it actually was. The servers were nice but throughout times, it felt they were scarce. Understandably so as each dining level seemed packed. I ordered clam chowder to start. While I hadn't had many before hand to compare, it was absolutely delicious. It was so creamy and had enough potatoes and clams to get a good mouthful with each bite. I may even go back just to grab two of these and call it a meal. As for the entree, my friend ordered the lamb curry where I ordered the grilled salmon. The look on our faces was just in awe. For the price of under $, we felt it was an absolute steal. The fish was moist and flaky - the skin had a satisfying crunchy. I don't like my veggies but with the sauce, not a morsel was left and same went with my friend's curry. The only downside of this place was the long wait for the meal to come. It was about , I didn't mind at all!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I've been to Hemingway's a few time and I must say Its always a good time. Firstly, the laid back ambiance compared to the surrounding establishments. This place is always welcoming.  . Multiple leveld of rooftop patio seating available to enjoy the warm weather. I haven't had to wait longer than a few mins for a table. The servers are nice and the service is efficient. Menu is broken down into categories and caters to most. There is no parking but thats expected for this location.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Went to Hemingway's on a Tuesday night and the vibe was really nice. Recommend the patio on the summers! The fries are really good and I recommend the fish tacos because of the large portion size - however, the cheese wasn't melted on top which was a bummer. The drinks were okay - I got a Peach Lemonade Shnapps but it tasted mainly like ice. Drinks are pricier.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Good place for a casual dinner with friends. Location is in Kensington. Both the service and interior are friendly and inviting. We had the double decker pizza, which was fun but next time I would like to try one of their regular pizzas. Someone else had the one topped with burrata which looked great. The four cheese gnocchi is very rich and the blue cheese flavour is very dominating, which I enjoyed but some people may not. All in all had a great time and would definitely come back for a relaxed and well priced meal.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Having pizza in Naples Italy ruined all other pizza for me...until I found Via Mercanti. The pizza here is the only pizza in the city that rivals that of the original Neapolitan pizza. This is the only pizza I will eat in the city. Done to perfection in every way--the dough, the sauce, the toppings all in perfect ratios.  If you are serious about your pizza this is where you want to be eating. My personal favourite are the Margherita pizza and the Nutella pizza for dessert. True Italian classics done to perfection. The service is fabulous. They go above and beyond for all their guests","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Authentic location for Napoli pizza! My friends spoke Italian to the owner and some of the waitstaff. My friend and I split two pizzas to try more, we had the PATATE E SALSICCIA (Fior di latte, potatoes, sausage) and CACCIATORA (Fior di latte, mushrooms, chicken, cherry tomatoes) and the tiramisu. All were fantastic! If you have a larger group, I'd highly recommend reservations.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We came here at the suggestion of an Italian and weren't super impressed. The pizza was on the pricier end and it wasn't even truffle pizza. The mushrooms were ok.

{"Review Text":"This pizzeria is my new favourite pizza spot! I visited this place on a Saturday at 5pm (made a reservation the weekend before) and enjoyed a delicious family dinner. Nestled in the middle of Kensington market, this hidden gem filled out bellies and churned out pizza after pizza. Our waitress was enthusiastic and friendly and was tentative to our needs. We started off with  - the batter was light, the shrimps were quite big and the calamari was tender. It came with their in house marina with a bit of pepper flakes on top. My only recommendation would be a bit more seasoning on the seafood. Next up were the pizzas. The crust was deliciously chewy with a hint of the wood fire burnt taste, it was sooo good! We ordered  (buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto, this was our favourite, so we ended up ordering a second pizza. Even my 4yo ate the prosciutto, which he normally wouldn't), the calzone was pleasantly good (we expected the usual thick crust and not a lot of toppings, but the one from this pizzeria is on the thin side, the center is packed with pepperoni and Bufala Ricotta - this is a must try!), the funghi pizza is flavourful but it could use more mushrooms, and the capricciosa  (prosciutto, mushroom, black olives - I didn't try this one because I don't like olives). We also ordered the linguine allo scoglio (seafood linguine), this had a good mix of mussels, shrimp, baby clams and calamari, but I would've like more of a sauce, it seemed like this was just tossed in olive oil. The food was great, the waitress was friendly and for , ordering , , , we could've made do with  - we didn't even have room for dessert (and I really wanted to try the ricotta and pistachio cheesecake...

I ordered the breakfast poutine since I wanted to try this since it's a Canadian thing. I have had this in the states but this was phenomenal. Egg, meats, potato's and gravy, and it was a great combination. My wife had the breakfast tacos. The waiter suggested for her to put the green Tabasco sauce on it. She can't take the heat so she didn't. But she gave me a bit which I added the hot sauce and it went with the flavors on the tacos. I would get the tacos next time if we go back. They have a lunch menu and it looks really good so we may try them for lunch before we leave. This place was so good we went back for breakfast and lunch the next day before we left. Service was great and our waitress at breakfast remember us. The egg Benedict was wonderful along with the potatoes and the French toast was the best that I've tasted. It could have been the maple syrup.  My wife said the waffle was the best she had. Now the person next to us got a waffle with fruit which my wife said she should have gotten since it looked better than what she had. Lunch was very good. I guess Montreal food is smoked but my sandwich had a great taste.  The meat and the cheese including the bread made the sandwich. I didn't need anything else. My wife's said the club sandwich was the best she's tasted. I am wondering if it's the bread. The onion rings were very good and I would get them again.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Eating here during a busy weekend on the patio under the Summer sun was an absolute delight! Having great company to roll along with makes it 10x better. There was a , which was a-okay as my family and I just killed time in the Eaton Center and luckily had a South Asian event happening by Nathan Philips Square, both which were in close proximity to Eggspectation. The \/crowded, there were even people from out of town and the States dining here! I got the crab cake benny which was delicious, albeit more soggy than crispy. Everything on the dish was fresh. The sliced potatoes could use for a little more seasoning though. I also ordered a mango\/orange smoothie of some sort and all I remember about it was being puckering sour, like way too sour. I wouldn't recommend it. I'm only giving Eggspectation a mid star review, because I think I romanticized the city patio brunch, more than the food. The food was good, but nothing to be blown away by. The service was also a bit brutal too, but I totally understand they were slammed that day. Paid with credit card.","Sentiment":"positive"}

The butter chicken was quite typical and good. Chicken Tikka masala was my favourite item with a thicker gravy and more traditionally cooked. Channa masala was surprisingly good too.

The dining area in the back of Bar Reyna was not only beautiful but also exuded fantastic vibes, creating an enchanting atmosphere. However, as the evening went on, it did get a little too dark to comfortably read the menu, so keep that in mind if you visit in the later hours. While the restaurant was moderately on the expensive side, the portions were on the smaller side, but the flavours were absolutely packed with deliciousness. Every bite was a culinary delight that left a lasting impression. A must-try is the MONTADITOS - MUSHROOM DUXELLE. We couldn't resist trying several different varieties of drinks, and they were all delicious, with a selection that satisfied our taste buds and added to the enjoyment of the evening. Our server was simply amazing, and I must say, the owner of the restaurant is bomb dot com. The personal touch and warm hospitality made our dining experience truly exceptional. In summary, Bar Reyna is a must-try, at least once. The enchanting atmosphere, delicious flavours, and top-notch service make it a standout destination for a memorable night out. Don't let the moderate pricing or smaller portions deter you; the overall experience more than justifies it. It's a place that deserves a spot on your own bucket list.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Walked into Bar Reyna on a Saturday night on a whim. It was moderately busy. They've got some interesting cocktails as well as some signature ones. We tried a mezcal based cocktail that didn't seem balanced; it was heavily smoky and sweet, completely lacked acidity. The other cocktails we ordered were more basic, like a Moscow Mule, but tasty. We also tried their Spanish fries which were actually more like Hickory sticks with a couple sad dried up chorizo crumbles on top. They tasted fine but just didn't live up to how they were advertised on the menu. The inside is decorated with a luxurious feel and the clientele was pretty mixed, some people dressed super casually and some looking like they just exited a club. Washrooms are up a flight of stairs. The service was intermittent and it didn't seem like any one person was assigned to us so we often felt forgotten about. I don't think I'd go back because the experience was decidedly \"meh\" which didn't match up to the fancy look and pricing of this place.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This place is probably good for a drink, but definitely not if you are mainly looking to get food.

Mmm these were the Italian ones. The ceviche was nice and I really liked the cauliflower bravas. But hands-down if you go here what you must get is the lamb baklava. It is out of this world! It sounds really strange but the saltiness of the lamb meat with the spices and then the crispy pastry and then the slightly sweet sauce that's on top is unreal. For dessert we tried the ricotta fritters with an orange blossom sauce. They were nice but really sweet so I don't think I'll fantasize about them later. Also prepare your soul the ceiling is so beautiful!!","Sentiment":"positive"}

Management may want to rethink that. Maybe it's some special fabric that resistant to stains. Anywho, the real reason you came, the food! We got their Spanish fries which had shaved manchego, chorizo, chipotle aioli YUM! We also got the crab eggs Benedict which is served cold and they do warn you.

Very creative, very tasty. Wish the portions were bigger though, especially since it was $. We also got the calamari and Lebanese tacos. Both were also really good. Prices were on the higher side unfortunately. For dessert we got kaffir lime and saffron baklava. Very pretty and decadent dessert, although my stomach felt weird after eating it.

{"Review Text":"My sister and I got three dishes: 1) The chicken mayo bowl which was delicious with crispy fried chicken, a healthy amount of mayo on a bed of rice. This was our favourite one among the three and ironically the cheapest. 2) The SCRS original which had a fluffy egg (a cooked yolk on cooked whipped egg whites) with meat in the form of a hamburger patty. I liked the idea of having different textures of egg being presented in an uncommon way. However, I wasn't the biggest fan of the texture of the egg whites. 3) sagogi which had steak with garlic chips, pickled onion, and kalbi sauce. The steak looked medium rare but was still hard to chew. All the bowls were both warm to room temperature minus the protein. Her Chef is inspired by the chef's own story and some of the patrons'. You can actually submit your story and have the chef recreate it through a meal.

With this particular store, I was really drawn into the story of cooking authentic Korean food for students that felt homesick. So I tried some of their top dishes and they did not disappoint! The Chicken Mayo bowl was the top item and I can really see why! It's so simple yet so good, as a crispy fried chicken rice bowl topped with some kewpie mayo. This is definitely something I could've seen myself eating every day as a college student. The First Place Steak Salad was also very deserving of its title because the filet mignon really melted in my mouth! The sauce that was part of the salad was a delightfully sweet and tangy flavor that reminded me that I was essentially eating Korean barbecue, and I would never be disappointed with that! I also had the Salmon Lovers Poki Bowl which was also pretty good. But after eating the other two items first, I felt that this item didn't have as much flavor as I would've liked.

{"Review Text":"The best brunch spot you can think of. I love that there is an alternative for those who don't eat pork (bacon) everything is big and the price tag is worth it for what you're getting. Don't sleep on Earl Gray Rose latte. Soooo good. The place is medium size and it does get busy rather quickly so plan ahead. The employees are quite nice and there's no rush to eat and run. We were there for almost 2hrs catching up and didn't have issues. But we also went on a not so busy day so definitely keep that in mind. I'd go again for sure.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"The Swiss Roll & Chiffon Uji Matcha Roll combo stole the show, but the Classic Buttermilk Mini Pancakes took it to the next level--, blueberries, blackberries, vanilla ice cream, and maple syrup. The Light Cafe Breakfast Sandwich was a breakfast dream come true. Hash browns, breakfast sausages, fried egg, tomato, lettuce, red cabbage, cheddar cheese, mayo, ketchup, all sandwiched between perfectly toasted bread. Choose between a side salad or waffle fries--both equally tasty!","Sentiment":"positive"}

It was a lot of food- I left feeling so full and satisfied! The mushroom croissant was delish. We came when it was bad weather, so it was not too busy and we were seated immediately. However, I can imagine that this place gets busy depending on the time. The inside was clean and nice. I would definitely recommend to others!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"It feels like a homestyle cafe with an open kitchen. I'd suggest a better ventilation system because I was sitting indoor and my clothes and hair stank after I left. I knew they're famous for brunches and waffles. But I wasn't too hungry on the day I visited, so I ordered truffle mushroom & bacon pasta. It's very home-style and the sauce was, perhaps, a bit too thin to my liking. I'll come back for the famous brunch and waffles~","Sentiment":"positive"}

Light Cafe offers Asian brunch fusion among diverse shops on Baldwin St. They're known for Cotton Candy Coffee: a sugary treat doused by black java, mixed with bottled milk. This time at Light Cafe, I tried the Lobster brunch plate comprising of: mini pancakes, egg benedict, waffle fries, house salad, bacon & sausage and lobster roll in croissant form with shrimp & celery. Tasty. They also offer an interesting mix of other freshly-prepped brunch dishes, pastas, waffles & desserts. Enjoy with calm cafe vibes.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Cotton Candy Coffee is literally just that: a ball cotton candy to be doused by black java, and then mixed with bottled milk.

They also offer an interesting mix of sandwiches, pastas, waffles and desserts worth trying on another visit.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We had a private event here the other night. The appetizers we got (calamari, arincini, meatballs, charcuterie) were probably the best out of all the food we had for the night. The gnocchi pasta we had was very doughy and mushy... was not appetizing at all. The chicken was also very dry and made it hard to eat. Many people who ordered the chicken did not end up finishing it. My friend had the fish which I fried and was definitely better than the fish though not good either. Overall, the food was very mediocre. Drinks on the other hand was great and shoutout to the two bartenders, they did amazing.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Once my filthy progeny finished painting the establishment with half their meals we settled up (quite reasonable despite the little one's lamb chops) and we walked home. A good time was had by all.

But look, I'm comparing Nodo to downtown restaurants and by those standards, it hits at a solid , especially the service. On a Thursday night at 8pm the place was bumping. The waitress came to take our drink order. When I pointed at the cocktail list and said \"Which....\" she interrupted me and said \"It's my second day! I'm not familiar with the cocktails.\" So I selected a cocktail. She accidentally entered the wrong one into the system, brought me the wrong one, took it back...and then I waited like 't available. I selected another one. Ten more minutes later, I was told there was a mishap at the bar, and was asked \"did you still want your cocktail??\" It made me feel weird, like, do you want me to say no? By this time both of my dining companions had finished their cocktails. Anyway, the pizza, seafood pasta and cheese\/charcuterie boards were all good, if middle of the road, when compared to the likes of Giulietta, Piano Piano or other downtown spots. Gosh I'm a snob!! :)","Sentiment":"negative"}

From the host to the multiple servers, everyone was friendly and professional. Our waitress Montana went above and beyond and exceeded expectations with my annoying requests for extra bread and butter, garnishes, an off-menu cocktail, etc. The food was also really delicious! Piping hot and steaming fresh... I ordered chicken, which could be so boring, but was really flavourful, juicy, and cooked perfectly. My friends had steak and also enjoyed every piece. We asked for one steak to be redone as it was a little overcooked, and Culinary Manager Adam appeared only moments later to apologize and send out a new and improved dish. Overall, this was really a great meal, evening, and experience. Highly recommend!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This is a few weeks overdue but hopefully useful to others, nonetheless. We decided to choose Keg Esplanade for an anniversary dinner. \u00a0Came in with no specific expectations whatsoever, and our faces glowed when we were seated at a table by the fireplace (it was a chilly night). Our server was Andrew and he was truly spotless on manneurism and professionalism. We opted for a calamari starter and a shrimp cocktail. \u00a0We had some questions about the drinks which were responded promptly and informative. We both chose steaks cooked rare and one of them (prime rib 14oz) was probably the softest most tender and juiciest we ever had. We do cook our steaks at home and at times eat out just to see that our at-home cooking is tastier and juicier than wherever we eat out; but this KEG piece blew us away. The horseradish that we got as a garnish was astounding. \u00a0We love horseradish and we mentioned our findings to Andrew, asking for the chef to be commended. Being full from the starters and mains, we decided to skip dessert. However, we tried the Billy Pie as per Andrew's suggestion -on the house as an anniversary token. One of the managers -Jeremy, came to us and thanked us for our appreciation. We will happily be returning to this Keg sometime soon!","Sentiment":"positive"}

I love this location because the staff are great and super informative, ambiance is to die for, everything is clean, and food is top notch! Not to mention their mojito is one of my favourites. I got my normal - 6oz top sirloin with garlic mash on the side. Let me just say, I don't if it's because I saved up my appetite for this or if it's because we just haven't dined in for a while, but the food was probably one of the best experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. My steak was soooo flavourful and tasty, really cooked to perfection. The garlic mash was equally as mouthwatering. And, of course The Keg's calamari is hands down my favourite. The sauces are delicious and the peppers it comes with are delicious. We were celebrating a birthday so they even gave us a complimentary slice of ice cream cake which is always a hit in my books. I wish I had taken pictures, but again, I assumed I already had written a review. I'll just have to go back to take some lol. Needless to say, we'll definitely be back! This location is highly recommended.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Chiado excels on many fronts: the customer service, the food, the ambience of the restaurant, and the high-quality dishes that you get. They truly excel when it comes to seafood and fine-dining experience (even for take-out!). We came for pick-up order (because dine-in was closed due to the lockdown at that time), and the awesome customer service was already shown right from the moment we entered the door. All the staff were super friendly and went above and beyond (even for a pick-up order), such as offering us to sit down and a drink while waiting. The inside of the restaurant was also very nice and had a classy, fine-dining atmosphere. In terms of the food, everything wow-ed us, especially the ginormous sizes of the seafood (especially the octopus leg and shrimps). Taste, freshness, portion size, and all aspects of the every dish were perfection. We ordered: - Arugula & Fresh Figs Salad with slivers of aged Lourais cheese, lemon & extra virgin olive oil - Grilled Octopus with red onion & sweet bell peppers salsa + roasted potatoes and vegetables - Monk Fish Loin with tomatoes, Madeira wine, and piri piri glaze + roasted potatoes and vegetables - Grilled Tiger Shrimps on Saffron Risotto - Pan Seared Skate Fish on Lemon Spinach Risotto - Vegetarian Risotto - SIDES: Saut\u00e9ed rapini, asparagus The salad was fresh and the fresh figs added a nice juicy sweetness - perfect compelement to the naturally slightly bitter arugula. The sizes of the grilled octopus and shrimps were just wow. They were cooked very tender (especially the octopus). It was probably one of the best octopus dishes I've had. Every main dish came with a good amount of vegetables and carbs (whether it be potatoes or risotto). We tried , and all of them were excellent. My favourites were the Saffron Risotto (aromatic, tasty, and felt like a comfort food with the mixture of soft rice and diced tomatoes) and Vegetarian Risotto (this contained a LOT of different kids of veggies - asparagus, rapini, spinach, snowpeas, carrots, red & yellow bell peppers). I highly recommend the Pan Seared Skate Fish - this was one of my favourite dishes at Chiado. The fish was SO soft and tender, and had a texture that was unique compared to any other fish. It was seared and seasoned perfectly. Another dish I recommend is the Grilled Octopus. Not only was the octopus leg ginormous and so soft & tender inside, but it also came with rapini, roasted mini potatoes, beets, sweet potato, carrot, and some other root vegetables. The red onion & sweet bell peppers salsa went really well with the grilled octopus. All the side vegetables were nice, not overly cooked, and not saucy or oily at all - just how sides are supposed to be. As a fine-dining restaurant, everything was definitely worth the price tag.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Easily my favourite Summerlicious . For $75, it makes such an expensive experience like chiado affordable for mere peasants like my broke student self.

The wines were tremendous, our waiter was awesome and fun. The main entries were delicious, the seafood were cooked correctly and their sauces were really good. The chef sent us complimentary housemade cow cheese slices with balsamic and honey which was incredibly soft and easily the best cow cheese I've ever eaten! I can still taste it. I hated the appetizers - this place needs to include some family style shareable apps. The ones we ordered \"for the table\" after consulting with the waiter were not appropriately portioned and none were really shareable. The grilled squid was bitter and had too much char in some pieces making it inedible. The sardines were fine and the mussels in white wine was just okay (I've had better). All in all, the apps tasted like they were cooked by an amateur while the entries and wines saved the day. I will be back but will not recommend Chiado for big groups. They don't really have anything that can be shared by families and they are going to lose a lot of business with this strategy.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Great looking gastropub on the Danforth with a wide variety of drinks for those who enjoy a nice drink.  We came here on a Monday night so it wasn't busy at all.  Servers were pretty attentive too but as much as I would love to give , there were some kitchen glitches. My girlfriend can't have any gluten so we ordered some gluten free calamari.  As soon as our waiter brought it out, he noticed right away that it wasn't the gluten free option.  Was great that he noticed it right away and also had it replaced right away.  Next my girlfriend's order of Kale & Quinoa salad with steak came except it wasn't.  The salad was incorrect but at least the steak and how it was prepped was.  So he simply had the salad changed up.  Our server was very apologetic and was nice so we weren't upset.  The service was still very pleasant and we'd still come back.  Just a little surprising to have these glitches considering it wasn't busy at all (we were ).  Gluten free options however, should be taken a little bit more serious.  Thank you to our server (forgot his name) for immediately seeing this!  Now let's get to the food review.... Gluten Free Calamari - Had the perfect texture and was lightly dusted with..something!  Was a pretty generous portion that .  This would taste great on one of their salads. 5\/5. Smoked Chicken Wings - We ordered this with bbq sauce on the side and to be quite honest, you don't even need the sauce.  The smoke was that flavourful and the wings were super crispy and juicy.  Definitely one of the best smoked wings I've had. I'd go back just for this and have it as a main. 5\/5. Arugula & Pear Salad - Definitely a must-try if you love arugula and goat cheese.  I did notice however how much more spinach there was then arugula.  Yes it's part of the plate but I personally would've preferred to have more arugula.  Salad had some warm goat cheese which was so so good and creamy.  The pear was a great part too and I usually don't care for any kind of fruit in my salad, regardless of how it's prepared. I think whether or not I can get more arugula, the salad was still very enjoyable that I would order it again. 5\/5. Ribs - I had a wicked craving for ribs and I was thoroughly satisfied with their bbq smoked ribs which literally fell off the bone.  I had some leftovers which I just had the other day and it tasted even better than that night. Definitely a must-have if you love meat. 5\/5. Hand-Cut Fries - This came with our ribs and it was so good.  I was so stuffed but couldn't help but keep on picking at the fries.  Makes me want to try their poutine next time. 5\/5.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"We found , as we were shopping nearby at Stackt Market, and wanted a place where we could sit down inside and eat which wasn't a 'fast food feel'. A quick review of the menu convinced us that all three in our group could find something they liked, so we walked over around 1:. There were several tables with groups of diners, but still lots of space available. The hostess decided to put us in a booth next to a window, which was perfect. The plants throughout the interior gave the place a comfortable peaceful vibe, and the light from outside made it feel bright and airy, but still cozy inside. The menus are online and you have to scan a bar code to see the offerings - this was one thing we didn't like. We know it's more environmentally friendly, especially when menus change often, but all of us had trouble getting the pages to load since we were from the states and roaming. There didn't seem to be a paper option though. Our server, Maxine, was great. She was very friendly and attentive. Among us we ordered a burger, an Earth Bowl, and a beet salad with added falafel. The burger came with a 'sea buckthorn jam' which we had never heard of, but Maxine was able to explain what it was like (sweet and tangy), offered to have the kitchen put it on the side, and also suggested some options for the fries that would compliment the zaatar spice. We appreciated all of her suggestions. The diversity of food offerings is amazing, with lots of vegan and vegetarian options and ways to add protein to any veggie-forward dish. We loved all of the food, but here are a few notes: The burger was perfectly cooked and served on a potato bun with a side of very thin pickles - it was very well balanced flavor and fat wise, and really enjoyable. The portion of zaatar fries it came with was huge and enough for all . The Earth Bowl was a lovely mix of long grain wild rice, roasted butternut (?) squash, chick peas, sunflower seeds, herbs, avocado and a delicious lime cilantro dressing. My sister is very sensitive to ingredients that are old or off and she remarked how very fresh and clean this tasted. The beet salad was served with a generous portion of beets over a roasted cauliflower puree. The description said it had a maple walnut dressing, pickled pears, fennel and candied pistachios. I added falafel for some carbs and protein. It was delicious but was very light on the nuts, and the pears and fennel were not detectable flavor wise...I would have enjoyed the depth from more flavors... So overall, a lovely experience that I look forward to repeating, but I took a star off since the menu would be a challenge if you didn't have good cell service, and my dish fell short of expectations based on the menu description.","Sentiment":"positive"}

We had the bacon . The bacon was so over cooked I took one bite and sent it back. My eggs looked perfect but never tried them. I actually stopped eating this terrible looking and tasting breakfast. My companion continued to eat her substandard breakfast but only ate third of it. The service was spot on and the interior was spot on except the place was freezing cold. Will stilled tip 25% to our server, because you shouldn't ever take a bad meal out on the server, believe me they will take it out on the kitchen. To the kitchen. My . There's nothing this boy can't cook when it comes to a perfect breakfast. Also to the kitchen. You are the first impression of the   hotel in the morning ,don't ruin it. When you screw breakfast up it has a way of screwing customers whole day up. That sucks !!! Ps after talking with friends about this terrible meal, apparently lunch is a Big Time hit and miss. Maybe it's time to pay the chef what they are worth then us the customers will benefit having a great meal. Premium price deserves premium food cook extremely well.

I had booked in advance so despite the overwhelming crowd got the spot quickly. The service is all over the place non existing to pleasant when paying the bill. I had the Norwegian eggs Benedict. Other person had the potato waffles plus the chicken add on. We both tried the honey ice cream, sugar pie with rhubarb I wanted to try the chicken so I had a piece. Oh this was so greasy that I couldn't get past the first bite. We are talking dripping oil all over sogfest. Eggs Benedict are decent but the house potatoes were all over smaller one being ok while larger pieces being undercooked Dessert were possibly the best item we ordered. Also it was so noisy that got noise fatigue an hour+ of sitting there. I can't possibly rate it better than 2..","Sentiment":"positive"}

Lots of plants everywhere and natural light. The food was very good!  I went with what the server recommended, which was the fried chicken sandwich. I ordered it with a Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was unlike any I've had before but was still very nice. The chicken sandwich was delicious but the chicken was . The fries are also very tasty!!

The decor is so lovely, plenty of pretty plants and green accents everywhere. The service was great too! All the servers are attentive & polite. Got the Greenest Goddess salad and it was really fresh and delicious. You can't go wrong with adding some protein on top because their chicken is bomb. We also ordered their Brunch Chicken Sandwich and it was SO good - the chicken was crispy, juicy, and seasoned to perfection. The only downside to this place is it's expensive for the amount of food you get - it would be nice if portions were more generous (esp since it's primarily veggies). Otherwise, it's a cute place with chill vibes.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I highly recommend the churassco, if you are having trouble picking something. It comes with the creamiest garlic mashed potatoes. And the tacos! And ceviche! Even when I take the food home with me and have it for leftovers the next day, the beef never goes hard in the fridge because it was prepared so tender in the first place!

{"Review Text":"Was super excited to check this place out due to all the incredible reviews. The ceviche was fresh, but didn't necessarily blow my mind. Carne asada was unfortunately very well done & super dry, the rice & peas were also dry. There was a side slaw that had some really browned avocado in it, which put me off. Although I will say the fried sweet plantain was the star of the show - very very yummy. The ambiance is cozy & feels very authentic, which we appreciated. The service was hit or miss - one server seemed frustrated with us & made a face quite early on in the ordering process. I also asked about my options as I have a dairy allergy & she said she didn't think a dish I was looking at had dairy, but wasn't sure & didn't offer to even check with the kitchen. For someone with an allergy, it terrifies you to eat at a restaurant when the care isn't put in to avoid exposing you to an allergen. With that said, another server came by not long after & was much more conscientious about this, & actually did check with the kitchen. Overall, the restaurant has a great homey feel to it, although the food didn't wow us & the initial service with one of the servers made me hesitant to come back in the future.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"There's an old expression that says that even when pizza is mediocre, it's still pretty good. I think the same idea applies to ramen, too. We showed up at Midori Ramen around lunchtime on a recent Saturday and the place was empty, though it did fill up the longer we stayed there. A quick perusal of the menu led me straight to the Spicy Tan Tan (\"Ground Chicken, Sesame Paste, Bok Choy, Housemade Chili Oil, Chili Pepper, Sesame Seeds\"). (I'll honestly never get sick of Tan Tan, which is way I pretty much have to order it when I see it on a menu.) The food arrived about twenty minutes later, which seemed like a long time considering we were the only customers, and sure looked promising. And while it's quite tasty and satisfying, I can't say I was ever blown away. All the components were there and yet the dish was missing something that took it over the top. The lack of bold flavors ensured that each bite was basically the same, and the noodles were very underwhelming to say the least. Still, much like so-so pizza, I enjoyed the concoction quite a bit. I just can't see myself ever returning, particularly given how many other ramen joints are in the area..","Sentiment":"positive"}

Price point a little higher than most places and ramen did not come with an egg. Service was the issue we had. We were seated first and another couple was seated next to us a few minutes later. The waitress comes and takes their order first then comes to us. Sure no big deal but then they proceed to get their food while we are still waiting. By the time they finished their meal we are still waiting so we ask the waitress what is the delay?  She told us 'oh sorry we got a lot of delivery orders so your food is coming soon'. We would think that dine in customers should be priority over delivery but yeah eventually we got our food but it was a big delay They did give us 10% off for the delay but will not be returning","Sentiment":"negative"}
{"Review Text":"Had dinner here right before 7pm which was the perfect time - no wait! I didn't have high expectations for this place but I was pleasantly surprised with the creamy broth. It was different than other ramen styles I've had - although a bit heavy as a result. I had the original tori paitan ramen with an egg. The thick noodles were cooked really well - great chewy texture. Something different is that each order comes with a slice of chicken and a slice of pork (rather than typically being just pork). The chicken was soft but I prefer having regular chashu. The Red Spicy was pretty much the same broth but with a bit of spice. We also shared a takoyaki appetizer which was good but took longer to come out. By the time we left, the restaurant was starting to fill up. Overall I liked the food here!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This place may be my new fave ramen place! Usually, I find ramen to be too salty and heavy, but this one was perfect. I tried the duck ramen, and it was perfect-- juicy duck, a lovely broth, great noodles, and a perfectly executed egg! What's not to love? As usual, I couldn't finish it in one sitting, but I'm happy to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Their takoyaki was also awesome; crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. The restaurant is small but they have this really cool seating area up front around a green space; loved that!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Finally got to try Midori after having it bookmarked for so long! I usually get spicy ramen but I decided to try something different based on other reviews. I got the black garlic ramen and w o w. So worth it. The broth was so flavourful and almost creamy. The garlic flavour wasn't overpowering but the taste was still there. I got the ramen with thin noodles and an egg. The chashu and chicken was a good size of protein for me. The thin noodles were chewy and delicious. Also shared the karaage and takoyaki with my friend and we loved both appetizers. My friend got the spiciest version of the red spicy and the broth actually tasted pretty mild. Restaurant is beautiful and service was great. I'll definitely return to try their other ramen!","Sentiment":"positive"}

Ambiance is simple and very dim lighting - minimalistic vibes. My friend had a food allergy and they dealt with it perfectly - asking us questions and informing us about all the ingredients which I loved, nice attention to detail and great hospitality. Our waiter was also super friendly and helpful, came to check on us every once in a while. And it was super fun to do sake bombs for the first time!! For the food, everything we had was delicious! Super fresh and flavourful. I think my favourite was the beef udon and the tuna tataki (not pictured). The takoyaki was also very delicious but honestly everything was 10\/10!

Saba pressed sushi: 8\/, but since I like saba cooked, this was delicious and great for sharing. Simple flavours are sometimes the way to go! Guu fries: 7\/\/ izakaya. Baked oysters: 9\/, always get this. Cheesy gooey goodness baked to perfection. It's presented in the oyster shell and has chunks oyster and potato mixed in. Comforting and delicious! Karaage (fried chicken): 9.5\/. Tastes the best with a drizzle of lemon and dipped into their sauce. A must get at any izakaya! Miso Cod: 8\/. Flakey cod that is moist and cooked to perfection. Kimchi udon: 7\/. Still nice and creamy though. Cheese mushroom bibimbap: 9\/. The wait staff mixes the rice together table side. Deliciously cheesy rice that is piping hot - yum! Hamachi collar: 7\/. The skin is so crispy and delicious. Flakey cooked meat as well, just a little hard to share though and could use a bit more seasoning. Niku Udon: 10\/! A salty creamy beef udon topped with nori and tobiko flakes. A large enough dish to share with the table. A must get!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"We went on a weekday, right after it opened. I recommend making a reservation, it gets pretty busy at night! I remember several people getting turned away since the whole restaurant was booked up by reservations (to be fair, I am not sure if it's like this everyday. On the day I went, one party had like 10-, which is half the restaurant space). Kakimayo is similar to the one at kinka (which makes sense if you think about the relationship between the restaurants). Delicious, giant, creamy, cheesy. Everything I could possibly ask for. I always love this dish. This is one of the dishes I crave the most during quarantine season  5\/: the spicy version if kaarage. I kind of expected the spice to be a dry seasoning rather than a sauce. I think you would enjoy this if you want a dish reminiscent of sweet and sour pork with a bit of a kick. I prefer the normal kaarage over this. I enjoyed the deep fried crispy strips it came with (seemed like deep fried wonton wrapper strips). 3\/, it came with  (most restaurants I've been to come with 6). Takoyaki is a dish I've never really had complaints about, I've never had bad takoyaki (though the ones with bigger chunks of octopus are more worth your money!) 4\/\/rice dish to eat with my tapas. The kimchi udon was good and a great staple to fill up on! 4\/...HOW IMPRESSIVE IS THE PRESENTATION (see attached pic). Me and my friend were so shocked when this came out because we didn't expect it to look so fancy. I've seen a few pictures of their other desserts, and you can tell a lot of effort was put into the presentation for them!cI honestly can not remmeber the name of this dessert. I couldn't find it on the menu or other pics if Guu on yelp\/instagram. I think there was hojicha and banana involved though...I remember liking it though!  4.5\/","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I love hot pot and Liuyishou is the only place I've gone out to eat it. I would otherwise just do it at home, but this is a great option if you want to treat yourself to an AYCE option and have a variety of ingredients. The service is usually pretty quick for how busy they get with a self-serve bar with snacks\/desserts\/apps\/sauces in the centre of the restaurant. I just wished they had Ipad ordering so you don't have to wait for a waiter or flip through pages trying to remember everything you wanted and already ordered. Final Thoughts: It's definitely cheaper to do hotpot at home, but when you don't feel like going through the preparation or want to treat yourself to an AYCE option this is a great spot. There is a variety of menu items all of which are pretty classic so hard to get wrong but some of my favourites include the beef\/lamb platter, bean curd, yam noodles, tomato soup base, and watercress. A surprising stand out for our whole table were the grapes at the self-serve bar! They were so crisp and sweet we cleared the bar aha","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Liuyishou Hotpot actually exceeded my expectations! This is the first time I ever had AYCE Chinese hotpot and it was a great experience. My friend and I shared 1\/\/'s spicy house special soup and out of both broths, the tom yum was a winner! The spicy house special soup was actually quite disappointing as it tasted just like chili oil and not much other discernible flavour. I made the mistake of sipping the broth and the oil coated my whole GI tract, haha. The tom yum on the other hand was the perfect balance of slightly spicy and sour! My favourite! It was light enough to sip and with udon, it was so good. For the meat, we got sliced beef and pork belly which were both cut thinly and so they cooked quickly when we dipped it into the broth. The watercress, taro, different selection of mushrooms, and bamboo shoots were also delicious. My friend, as an experienced hot pot eater, recommended we get all the dumplings, meat balls and paste (shrimp paste). They were all so good! These were also my favourite, in addition to the veggies. For dessert, they had some small slices of cake - chocolate\/coffee, mango, and strawberry. They also had some fried red bean sesame balls which were also great. I also grabbed a couple of fruits (orange and grapes) to push all the hotpot down. I actually totally forgot to try the fried buns as other reviewers recommended so I will definitely get that next time. For two people, the bill came out to ~$. Although I don't think it was quite worth the price, the experience and food was certainly good and I will return!","Sentiment":"positive"}

We also had the red snapper, which was cooked to perfection, with a crispy skin. The pineapple based sauce with lime complimented the fish well. Finally, we finished with the delicious meatballs and peach ragu, which had a balanced sweetness. The sour dough was also soooo good, and great for mopping up the delicious sauce.

{"Review Text":"Dishes are presented with eccentric names that has a Trader Joe-like feel, such as the Hand Upstream Rolls ($22), which presents the upstream swimming fish, salmon, cured into gravlax form and covers it with cream fraiche and plum sauce. I enjoyed the meaty chunks of fish but wish the chefs weren't so heavy handed with the sauce, it masked the salmon's flavours and made it difficult to wrap in the nori. While pairing tomatoes with bonito seems strange, the Tomato Tonnato ($21) was one of our favorite dishes of the night. Somehow, the fish flakes' umami essence and the juicy heirlooms just work, bringing out the freshness of the fruit but giving it a bit of je ne sais quoi as well. In fact, Lake Inez's most simple sounding dishes were the tastiest. The Humble Potato ($19) featured big chunks of well-fried, roughed up potatoes that have a lovely crispy coating and tosses it in a flavourful Gouda queso. While the dish may sound heavy, the addition of herbs and anise hyssop (an edible flower) added a freshness to the cheesy potatoes. Along the same vein, the Corn Puddin' & Baby Shrimp ($23) was a lovely dip of hot gooey Fresno sauce studded with sweet corn and a fair amount of just cooked through shrimp. While it was tasty, it would be even better with more seasoning and salt. Still, the bread plate sized tortillas added a sunniness to the dish that I couldn't help but smile when seeing it. The Wham! Bam! Thank You, Ham! ($22) started with promise with slices of lightly cured country ham paired with sweet Korean melon and pears. But then the pickled watermelon rind and pickled peanuts were so pungent that after getting a bite of these that's all I could taste. It seems Lake Inez really likes sour flavours as the Cucumber?! I Hardly Know Her! ($19) was also too tart for my taste. The diced crunchy cucumber was tossed with a cashew cream that seems to contain a fair amount of preserved lemon. Aside from the refreshing cucumber and lemon, the other flavours were rather muted as I couldn't really taste the curry leaves or much salt. This was a divided dish for the table. The Miami Memory ($28) contained a piece of well-seasoned blackened snapper that had a nice spice but was over cooked. While it was considered a larger \"main\" dish, there was a scant portion of snapper, and the shredded greens and couscous side didn't increase it's substantialness by much. Mama's Meatballs ($; $) was more generous and the better of the two mains if you're hungry. Mama makes moist and not overly dense meatballs and the peach ragu and mostarda lightens the otherwise hearty dish. Serving these with a large hunk of buttered toast was smart to help mop up the sauce.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Lots of seafood, ie tuna, lobster etc. one of the dishes was pork and I let them know beforehand that I don't eat meat. No biggie. The pork was replaced with fish in the exact same sauce. It was a pricey evening but oh so worth it.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Had dinner here a thursday evening and it was quite enjoyable. We had a reservation, and it got quite busy at around 7pm, so would definitely recommend getting a reservation. Restaurant is very quaint with very unique decor choices and and overall easygoing atmosphere & vibe. Service was pretty good, but they're definitely short-staffed. As it got busier, service became less attentive. They had , including bartending; so patience will be important. The food was overall very good! My favourite was definitely the chicken liver mousse and Nachos. We ordered  (they recommend 3-). Fennel moment - this was sort of like a fennel sour cream dip with thin crisps to smear the dip on. It was pretty good, but I was hoping for more fennel and fennel flavour as fennal has a strong licorice flavour if eaten raw. Chicken liver mousse - my fav dish of the night. If you've had chick liver mousse before, it can be very heavy and rich. by adding the sour cherry and hazlenuts, it was the perfect combo and when served on the rice crackers, it was delicious! we are depressed thus: nachos: definitely order this, it was VERY cheesy (in a good way) and so delicious. it's slightly spicey but not to the point where you actually feel it... so people who don't enjoy spice (which is unfathomable to me!) can likely still eat it without being torched. wild watercress clams in brodo: this was pretty good, especially the black bird bread and the broth! BUT I wish it was mussels instead of clams, simply because there were about , and it seemed like a tiny portion after you remove the shells... Clams are expensive and have a tiny yield. Mussels are relatively cheaper and much meatier. The sauce is 100% the star. Lastly, their drinks were quite good. Yuzu margo cocktail was refreshing and unique, and the nothing lasts forever cocktail definitely had a good amount of Johnny Walker black & lagavulin so that you can actually taste it. Big wine selection as well Overall really enjoyed Lake Inez and very solid .","Sentiment":"positive"}

We order one of each and it was a little bit ok to take time to make for . When the dishes came, we were shocked. In our group, . We didn't expect the portion of each was so big. A kid couldn't finish an adult size of dish. The waitress who took the order should have alerted the guests, when she saw that kids were also ordering. The restaurant was like all day breakfast. I got Morning Bagel and my Husband got , another couple got All Time Breakfast, and Morning Bagel. The kids got  & Sausages, Breakfast Waffles, Steak and Egg. Those were big portions that an adult barely could finish one plate. We packed out the rest. The food was ok, the service was not really, not sure if it was too busy or what, we have to ask for water multiple times, asked for doggy bags for multiple times before they brought us. The only thing I would highlight is that this is a 24\/.

{"Review Text":"CONSUMER ALERT!\rAvoid this establishment! Upon finishing our meal we were presented the bill which I promptly paid via debit, adding a 15% tip. Noticing the bill was high (after the fact) I double checked, and sure enough, it stated that they automatically added a 15% tip prior to me adding another. No problem, I'll just ask my server to fix what I assumed was an honest oversight. 'No' I was told, the 15% tip was clearly marked on the bill and there was nothing she could do about it. OK, first of all, if you engage in non-standard practices such as automatically adding 15% to a bill, the least you could do is verbally alert your customer of such, especially when you watch them add the amount a second time. Nope. Secondly, when made aware of such an oversight, you'd think to rectify the situation with as little fuss as possible. Nope. She (and her manager) both doubled down and insisted there was nothing they could about it once the transaction went through (patently false, it's done all the time). They then went so far as to blame me for not paying enough attention to what was on the bill! I assured them that the charges could be reversed and that if they weren't, my bank would reverse the entire amount. Surprise! They suddenly found a way to do so, but not before another group of patrons (who overheard the conversation) declare that this was the 3rd time they alone had witnessed the same disagreement with others! So, clearly not an oversight but a deliberate, predatory and dishonest attempt to bilk customers. Appalling! And they still had the gall to charge me the original tip - which, if I recall correctly, is intended to be a reward for good service and customer satisfaction. They do not deserve anyone's business.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Vibes immaculate, aesthetic ideal, food & drink great! This review encompasses the 5th visit I've had here and my thoughts about this place remain the same-- come here! The cafe is a converted three story townhouse that is decorated and dimly lit with candles to provide an intimate setting for a meal with friends or a date with your partner. Service has always been terrific every time I have been here. The food comes quick, staff are courteous, and reactive to your requests. Now the food, we had an amazing caprese salad with nice buttered baguette slices. It was an amazing starter that is actually quite large. We also shared a pizza that was honestly perfect, amazing crust that was crisp at the bottom and topped with plenty of cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and truffles. Not once have I ever felt disappointed with the food here. Do come here. Seriously. I mean it!","Sentiment":"positive"}

The other one that is pineapple-based and served on a porcelain \"kitten\" cup was too sweet though for me. Food didn't have MSG which was exactly what I preferred. Sushi and sashimi at par with other Japanese places. In comparison, it was better than Sushi Legend in general. Not saying Sushi Legend is bad but just comparing side by side, this place a notch better. Matcha based dessert cake is highly recommended. My colleagues did the Sake Bomb thing.

{"Review Text":"Some friends and I came to Kinka while visiting for the weekend. We were lucky enough to come during their restaurant week aka the Kinkalicious menu set. I thought it was a great deal for the amount of food we got to try. We started off with the miso soup. Pretty standard and tasty. Next was the tofu and seaweed salad. I also didn't think this was anything super unique or earth shattering, but good. Salmon Tataki was next, this one was a game changer for me. Big fresh cut of salmon and the taste was great. Then Tokyo Fries which sort of reminded me of their take on poutine. I enjoyed the sauce and liked the skinny cut fries. Next the Karaage, this was cooked perfectly and tasted great with the squeeze of lemon. My favorite part of the meal was the Cheese Bibimap and Oysters. Both of these were hands down the best IMO. Flavorful and unique. We finished off the meal with a simple green tea ice cream. An outstanding meal overall and loved their cocktail menu as well. More than just the simple sake or beer. Definitely recommend giving them a visit!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"We had the pleasure of dining at Rikki Tikki on a Saturday night with a group of friends. This restaurant is new. We chose to sit outside, and not only did we enjoy great food, but we also witnessed a unique show. We saw someone being chased for stealing from another person, and a couple of homeless individuals approached us asking for food. I don't blame the restaurant for this since it seemed these homeless individuals were approaching many places, so I won't hold it against them. I am giving this restaurant five stars because our server, Rashmi, was very accommodating, and the food was excellent. We ordered chicken tikka masala, lamb Rogan Josh, , and a few vegetarian dishes that were delicious. The only criticism I have about the restaurant is that they were out of the beer I wanted and didn't have lamb chops available, even though they were listed on the menu. The only reason I'm not deducting a star is that I've noticed other restaurants also being out of stock on certain items, which I found peculiar. Food was reasonably priced as well Overall, I recommend visiting Rikki Tikki and giving them a shot","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Found this place on Yelp and was so excited to try it. We originally came for the $. My siblings and I shared the paneer tikki fries ($9.95), chicken tikka masala ($14.95), and dal makhani ($11.95). The paneer tikki fries are like the Indian version of poutine with their delicious and rich butter sauce and pieces of paneer on top. There was also some shredded cheese and with the hot crispy fries, everything was hot and great together. The chicken tikka masala was also delicious, cooked in a rich fenugreek-flavoured tomato gravy with a healthy amount of bell peppers and onions. The dal makhani was also fantastic - super rich and creamy and hearty with the whole black lentils and red kidney beans. We got garlic naan ($3.5) and roti ($2.5) and they were fresh and hot. This was actually the first time I tried authentic and fusion Indian food and it won't be my last. Service was great. Washrooms were clean. The whole restaurant is spacious with lots of seating and the ambience feels pretty polished. There weren't that many people eating during lunch time. I think this place is a hidden gem but definitely a little pricier.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I would come back for the tuna, it's one of the best I've ever had. Not only does it melt in your mouth, but the olives and potatoes were just as impressive. The service was good, friendly waiters. I like the ambiance, classy but also comfortable and warm at the same time. Good for dates, friends, or family. The seats at the centre of the restaurant for twos seemed slightly tight. I was comfortable as the restaurant wasn't busy but I can't imagine a full house in those seats.  I enjoyed seeing their large open kitchen and bakery at the front. I was very intrigued by the large bread station near where I was sitting -- it looked and smelled delicious but I didn't get a chance to try it as I didn't want to pay $.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"My boyfriend and I picked this place for dinner while exploring the Distillery District. We wanted to try something new and so it was our random pick for the night. We were greeted warmly by the staff and were seated promptly. The inside was beautiful- the ceiling was a work of art with its geometric shapes, the chairs had intricate patterns that reminded me of luxe wallpapers. The vibe was quiet and the lights were dimmed low, so it had a romantic vibe. Then we were warmly greeted by our waiter. Since this was our first time at the restaurant, we asked for his recommendation. He recommeded a few dishes and some wines. I ordered Butter Roasted Monk Fish and my boyfriend ordered Black Cod en Papillote. We also ordered a white wine (two glasses) and Miel d'amour for dessert. Butter Roasted Monk Fish was delicious, I enjoyed the creamy texture of the jus, the melt-in-your mouth texture of the fish, and the light crunchiness of the kale. Black Cod en Papillote was my boyfriend's pick- he said that the fish was moist and yummy. However, he didn't like the rest as he couldn't taste much flavour. Also, he found the portion size in comparison to the price to be a mismatch. Therefore, he still felt hungry after the main. The white wine was good with our meal- we're not much of wine drinkers, so we had some sips and couldn't finish the rest. Miel d'amour was delicious and beautiful- it was lightly sweet and soft. The honey cotton candy and bee pollen were so fun to eat! We appreciated the staff's warm welcome, the attention to detail in the presentation of the food, and the attentive service. This would be great place to go to for a date, a special night out, or a celebration. Note: The price of food is on the expensive side. The portion size is smaller than what you would get at an average restaurant (e.g. Pickel Barrel, The Keg). Appetizer starts at $20; main dish starts at $33, and dessert starts at $17. Be mindful about this before you decide to go here, as it's a fine dining restaurant.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Food was worse than mediocre: the appetizers were tiny and uninspired, my gnocchi main was one of the blandest I've had (although I did hear good things about the chicken from others at my table), and the dessert was downright repulsive. The menu had a very pretty description of the \"summer fruit sabayon\" but the most refined part of the actual dish was the sugar. Service was remarkably slow and food arrived at least an hour late. At some point we started getting up and pouring ourselves water. I didn't see the bill but I'm sure that the gratuity was through the roof too. The decor was quite nice, if that's the only thing that matters to you. But if you're thinking of coming here while the Christmas market is on: don't.

Although they still use QR code menu and ordering system, the staff were attentive and will also be able to take orders. I got the tenderloin tonkatsu (pork tenderloin) and takoyaki. Overall a good meal. At a decent price ratio. But some points of disappointment for me. The meat was nicely tenderized, good portion and presentation. Comes with miso soup, cabbage salad, rice and tonkatsu sauce. Was looking forward to freshly grinding my own seasame, but the sesame came sprinkled in the sauce. Miso soup was nice to have, but sadly the wakame seaweed was boiled in the soup too long, resulting in mushy strands. The katsu itself unfortunately had a soggy bottom. Maybe not quite the right frying temp or not enough resting period? There's more improvements to be made to the frying technique here. I recommend eating them upside down for better crunch experience or to order katsu curry instead. Since it will sit in sauce anyways the soggy bottom is no longer an issue. The takoyaki is the deep fried not authentic variety. Can be skipped next time.","Sentiment":"positive"}

I have to say we were expecting something a little more lively (we saw a TikTok advertising it) but to be fair it was 4pm lol. It, of course, got progressively busier as time passed and with that the ambiance improved. The location was cute, right off the subway to its an easy commute from wherever you're at. The inside is well air conditioned. The patio is decent, it's not very well separated from the street. The wait staffer were very friendly and helpful and the service in general was speedy and great even when it was busier. The drinks were really good (we did some shots and then the bar rail doubles since it was within happy hour). Make sure you drink plenty of water though because the shots are super sweet, definitely the recipe for a terrible hangover. The food was good, although we only really tried from the bites menu. I will be going back to try the burgers. The calamari and potato skins are very good! Definitely recommend. The place was all in all very fun!! The cheap food and drinks were definitely a huge plus.","Sentiment":"positive"}

It's a very haphazardly made burger so it got very messy to eat. And the toppings and all the sauce  made the bun soakeddddd so it basically fell apart a quarter of the way.

{"Review Text":"I'd been meaning to check out Mogouyan Hand-Pulled Noodles for a long time, so when I found myself in the area recently, I figured it was the perfect time to stop by. Everything on the menu looked delicious, but I decided to go with my old stand-by of Dan Dan noodles. I was asked how thick I wanted my noodles (regular) and how spicy I wanted the dish (very). The concoction arrived a little while later and looked just about picture perfect. It tasted even better, somehow. The components on their own aren't really anything special, but once you mix everything together, the dish really sings. It's got these layers of flavor that keep revealing themselves the more you eat. The spice level wasn't quite where I wanted it, but that was easily corrected by a liberal application of the chili oil on the table. And as for those hand-pulled noodles, they're terrific. They're dense and chewy like all good hand-pulled noodles are. So good. Service was quick and efficient, too.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Pretty good but also I might be biased since I think it's an amazing combo (it's probably hard to go wrong with this cold dish anyway).

I went because I saw someone on ig advertise about the asialicious special which comes with a seafood hotpot, large popcorn chicken and  $40. We were told to scan the qr code for the online menu. I asked him about the asialicious special, but it didn't sound like he knew what I was talking about so he had to go to the back and ask, not sure if he was new or no one informed him. He came back to confirm that they had it, so I told him I wanted that asialicious special. He said okay and walked away. We sat there for a good . I told him I thought we ordered the asialicious special already... he made a mistake and maybe misheard what I said in the first place. He said he would ask the kitchen to rush the order and asked us how we wanted our bubble tea. The post I saw on ig had rose tea, and that's what I wanted, but he only gave me green or black tea options. I went with green and got black for the second drink. The popcorn chicken came out first with the bubble teas and the chicken was pipping hot with a spicy mayo on the side.  About . It had meat, seafood balls, imitation crab meat, spam, clams and a ton of veggies! In . We let the veggies simmer down and meat cook completely before we took some and enjoyed the food. There was a delicious sauce to add to your hotpot for more flavour and add some spice. The popcorn chicken was crispy and juicy on the inside and was a good portion. We added the udon egg once there was some room in the pot. All in all, it was a good value for the meal, and the food tasted pretty decent. I knocked off some points for the confusion, and the washroom being such a pain to get to.

The server recommended the Schnitzels, so my partner ordered the Pork Schnitzel which came with mushroom cream sauce served with Belgian frites and a creamy delicious slaw. Obviously we didn't stop there and I had to finish off our meal with dessert. You can't go wrong with anything you order - the Belgium waffles are the BESSSSST thing I've had in a very long time. The waffle was made to perfection with some sprinkle of sugar topped with Nutella on top and a big scoop of vanilla ice cream and loads of whip cream on both sides of the plate! I used to go to Sin & Redemption a lot during University (which was and still is my favorite pub... offering a huge variety of beer options) and I was told this was the sister pub to this.

We sat inside the restaurant and I have to say on a hot day, the restaurant can get very stuffy and hot. Prices are average when you compare it with other restaurants downtown. Food quality was excellent. I ordered the lamb shank and B got the currywurst and beef stew. I had a taste of the currywurst, I do like the sweet curry taste. The beef stew was delicious. My lamb shank was a good portion. It was also very delicious. My friend M ordered the Crown Crier Burger for $17. The burger was made with prime rib beef.

{"Review Text":"Mineral is a high-end Filipino restaurant with great vibes and good quality food, however I was hoping for a stronger Filipino flair. I thought it would be traditional Filipino food with a twist, but was more Asian fusion than pure Filipino cuisine. The Ensaymada with Duck Prosciutto and truffle butter was my favourite. It was my first time having duck prosciutto and I fell in love with it - the only prosciutto I want is duck from now on . The pineapple with Kombu is also a surprisingly good combo. The duck confit was made very well, the duck was very juicy inside and crispy on the outside. Their Kare Kare sauce tasted very much like Chinese peanut sauce to me. Kare Kare is supposed to be a peanut butter based beef & oxtail stew. This peanut sauce was sweet and bright but was lacking the heartiness that the oxtail and beef innards would have brought. It was served with their house XO sauce. I've never had Filipino cuisine that tasted so similar to Chinese cuisine, but I'm not sure if it's supposed to taste like this. As for service, staff is very attentive and friendly, but it would be more interesting if they explained the origins of the dishes in further detail. We tried the tasting menu at $ & below is what we tried. Apps - complimentary amuse bouche: cold creamy soup. such a firecracker start to the meal. One of my favourite dishes of the night. - oyster with Asian pear - Shrimp with yuzu creme fraiche & mango chili sauce - Pineapple with Kombu - Tuna kinilaw (Philippine ceviche) on shrimp chips: the tuna was a little too fishy 2nd round of apps? - Ensaymada with Duck Prosciutto - Scallop Inari Pockets Main - Duck Confit Kare Kare - Crispy broccolini: my husband was in love with this dish - With Tamaki Gold Rice Dessert - ube leche flan: delicious strong ube flavour, as it should be","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"(An open letter to Mineral) My Dearest Mineral, I think I'm in love with you. When we first met back in 2019, I was instantly intrigued by your Filipino fusion ways. You had a pork neck wrap that I couldn't stop nibbling, a duck leg that was so tender, and seafood noodles that had me seeing stars upon first slurp. I wasn't completely head over heels about you yet then, given you're a bit pricey and offered a limited menu. But I went back a few times and knew I wanted to get to know you more. Then suddenly, you left for someone called Covid, and I wasn't sure whether it would be out-of-sight-out-of-mind or absence-makes-the-heart-grow-fonder. But now you're back, and after seeing you a couple of times since, I know it's the latter. Yes, you've changed a bit. Your Filipino roots are still there, but you've branched out more. And the change is good. Tried a few things at our last date and thought they were really good. The scallop inari pockets are not just a thing of beauty but also really tasty and well executed. The crispy brocollini is easily one of the best veggie dishes I've had in the city. The wrapped cod wasn't my favourite, but was flavourfully nuanced and delicately executed. The pairing of foie gras with your butter-golden ensaymada buns just brought it to another level. And the miso and pear torte had just the right level of sweetness, and that coconut pandan sorbet was the perfect complement to it. But I'm a sucker for your Filipino-based dishes. And the absolute standouts to me were a new dish and an old classic. The beef shortrib sinigang I tried for the first time was soooooo good. The beef was fall-of-the-bone tender and glazed perfectly. But it was the sinigang broth with its distinct sour-savoury that made this dish one of my favourite beef dishes in the city, period. And of course, your classic ube leche flan dessert is still one of the best fusion desserts I've had. So yeah, I'll scream it from the rooftops: I love you, Mineral. I know you are still a bit pricey and have a smaller space and a short menu. But you are absolutely perfect in how you create dishes that are comfortingly familiar but excitingly new. I hope you'll accept my proposal for a long-term relationship. And don't worry, we can keep it open so the rest of the world understands how amazing you are. ps: That said, please please please bring back your seafood noodles!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Prior to the world shutting down, my wife and I went to Mineral a couple of times when it opened in : instead of making it about in-your-face bold flavours, Mineral combined the subtleties of cuisines to create dishes that were faintly familiar yet excitingly new. So when Mineral reopened recently, we went back to see whether it still had \"it\". And I'm both happy and sad to report that Mineral is still all about the subtle intricacies. First the sad: the tough thing about subtleties is that they require more complex calibration. And this is where the world shutting down threw a bomb in all this - because it now has fewer people in the kitchen and may not be able to access the same ingredients, Mineral has had to change its menu to what the chef said made more sense given the realities of today. That meant getting rid of two of my favourite dishes - the absolutely sublime seafood noodles and the fall-off-the-bone-tender duck leg. I hate to penalize them for this, but with an already limited menu, losing two of your best dishes is a big blow. I'm grateful my other favourite dish (the chef's-kiss tasty pork neck wraps) is still there, and hope at some point Mineral is in a good enough position to bring these dishes back. Now on to the good: when you're good, you're good, global pandemic be damned. And while I missed the previous menu, the stuff we tried in this visit still made for a really enjoyable meal: - Pineapple and Kombu: May sound weird but it works. The sweetness of the pineapple pops when overlayed with the dullops of chili, and crunches with the sprinkling of puffed rice. - Scallop Salad: Good cook on the scallop, generous with the lettuce, nice contrast with the corn, though a tad heavy-handed with the dressing. - Duck Noodle: Really tender duck, strong eggy taste with the noodles. I thought this was good, not great (maybe coz I was so anchored on my favourite duck leg and seafood noodles dishes).  My wife doesn't like duck so just ended up eating the noodles and all that was stacked on it (corn, shiitake, basil) and she liked this. - Pork Neck Wraps: Hello old friend. We missed you. - Lech Flan: Again, great contrasts. The absolute sweetness of the flan balanced by a generous heaping of peanuts and the drops of guava. Also, this has nothing to do with anything, but beautiful plating. - Ensaymada: I was really disappointed with this the first time we tried it so that we passed on it our succeeding visits. But the server told us they made a tweak, and so got it this time. And wow, really glad we did because the bun just seemed more pillow-y this time, the cheese was more melted in an integrated way, and the side garlic butter just topped everything perfectly. We got a second order since we liked it so much. Overall, Mineral is still a winner. Definitely recommend checking it out.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I'm not a big fan of fusion restaurants (why ruin awesome cuisines by mashing them up and diluting them?!), but Mineral does it absolutely right. Instead of taking the boldest flavours of each cuisine to make sure you understand the fusion, it takes the most subtly distinct ones and delicately combines them together, creating dishes that are faintly familiar yet excitingly new. I've had both their lunch and dinner menus, and the standouts were the Seafood Noodles (the broth has an amazing sour taste that acts as a great base for the smoothness of the noodles and the freshness of the seafood), the Roasted Duck Leg (fall-off-the-bone tenderness of the duck, with the peanut sauce adding a nice bite), and the Grilled Pork Neck (standard meat-in-lettuce dish, if the meat was next level tasty). Docking a star for the limited menu (think I've tried 80% of it in ), and the disappointing ensaymada (tastes like standard bread) and mushroom noodles (tastes like standard pasta). Overall though, Mineral is a winner.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Tuna Kinilaw: This was their take on a tuna tartare. The tuna was plentiful and had a great balance of flavors, not to mention the crab chips were so good! They were crispy and not oily at all Ensaymada: This was like a really soft and warm butter roll, with cheddar and honey with truffle butter on the side, it was DELICIOUS! We added the optional foie gras and it was so rich and decadant! Lingcod: This was roasted in a banana leaf with caramelized coconut and a tomato dill salad. The fish was tender, however I think I was expecting more umami flavors. Confit Duck Leg: This was actually really good. The duck was so tender, and the peanut jus at the bottom was fragrant and aromatic Ube Leche Flan: This dessert was unreal, it had this creamy ube flan with pieces of honeydew, as well as crunchy bits. I can't wait to come back for this The service was great, even though we only booked a bar spot, they had a table open up and offered for us to sit at a more comfier booth. The interior was also really cool, the ceilings looked hand painted and their kitchen\/bar sitting area was interactive. Their cocktails were also delicious. The bartender was accommodating, made me tasty vodka based drinks that were off the menu. I definitely want to come back and try their pork neck and filet mignon!","Sentiment":"positive"}

They used to have boquerones but now the panne con tomate with white anchovies remain. The crudo is made with a a different white fish depending on season, and is fragrant with generous olive oil dressing and tiny chili slices. We were pleasantly impressed with the burger, which has substantial juice and body despite not being like a trendy smash burger. Instead of fries there are kettle chips.

I also ordered the weekender meal with poached eggs, adding locally smoked salmon, and subbing gluten-free toast. I was impressed with everything on my plate, and took the salad, and part of the salmon and sweet potatoes home because I was so full. I bought a morning glory cookie to try later. I am actually eating it now, and it is so moist and delicious! I am enjoying the contrast between the chewy inside and the crunchy outside. I enjoyed the salad for lunch, and loved the contrasts between the different parts of it. It wasn't just dressed lettuce. It also had shredded carrots, slivers of fresh asparagus, and was topped with pepitas.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Met up with a friend for brunch and I was looking forward to a healthy meal. We ordered at the counter and grabbed our number for the table. I usually gravitate towards meats but today I wanted to make veg focused choices. The lunch\/brunch combos offer so many possibilities. Do you want cold or warm sides? Steak, fish, chicken, tofu? Maybe a soup with salad? I was so pleased with my quinoa salad (so much more than just quinoa) and roasted cauliflower. Surprisingly filling and tasted great! The soup was a minestrone full of vegetables. It seems like the menu changes depending on the season. The restaurant is bright and spacious with plenty of seating. The service was really good. Your order is delivered to your seat and cleaned up when you're done. I'd definitely recommend this place for a casual meet up.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"What a lovely place! Came here for brunch with my friends, and I absolutely adored it. The service is quick, the food is very affordable, and delicious! I ordered the smashed avo plate which came with grilled tofu. I really liked it, and I especially liked how this place did not skimp on the amount of avocado. The grilled tofu was also super unique and provided a great vegan option :) My favourite thing was the chocolate chip cookie. I won't lie, I have my fair share of CCC throughout my life, but this one was possibly the best cookie I've ever had. It was so fresh, with a little bit of crunch but a nice chew, it wasn't too thin but it wasn't too dense, nor was it too sweet. It was a perfect combination of gooey yet it still had structure. I would come again just for that cookie!! The ambience was also super nice, and there was no rush to get up to leave. I would definitely come here again!! 10\/10 :)","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"One of the best options in the city if you're looking to err more on the side of healthy, whole food meals. Super duper pricey, however I've found the Be Square to be very filling - I tend to finish off the protein in one sitting but have to keep half the sides for another meal later. Highly recommend the flank steak, sweet potatoes & masala cauliflower, the seasoning\/sauces are delicious. The weekender breakfast is also a great option - the sourdough gets olive oil instead of butter on it, which I love for us lactose people. I do it up with poached eggs & add the flank steak for a protein-packed meal. Their cappuccino unfortunately doesn't do it for me - their espresso is super tart & sharp, not smooth. However the hot apple cider with cinnamon on top is great for a cold day. All in all, Mary Be is a place I continuously come back to. Everyone who works there is kind & the place has a nice fresh atmosphere.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"This is one of my favourite places to dine in mid-town. Their food is really second to none, in both in flavour and experience. Sometimes, when I dine out, I have a terrible experience after the meal - usually due to excessive salt used, but that is never the case with Mary Be Kitchen. Their food is tasty and healthy, and they have a great selection of dine-in options (and also take home\/pantry\/freezer options, as well). I usually get their Be Square option with . I really like all their protein options, but I don't think the fish is worth the additional $$$.  My favourite sides are the Mac n Cheese, Roast Sweet Potatoes (love their sauce!), turmeric rice, kale cesar salad and roasted cauliflower. In the summer, they rotate in some lighter options, and I always go for their summer green beans. I find their brunch portions to be a bit lacking in portion size, as I usually frequent this place after a hot yoga session and I am starving. I need to supplement my brunch with a cookie - which is not the end of the world, but when you add total the cost of coffee + brunch main + cookie plus TIP  - brunch is now upwards of $. A bit steep for brunch if you ask me. But their salted chocolate chip cookies is amazing, so there's that. For take-out, I love their Be Together option. Even though we are a household of two, I love it for leftovers. You cannot go wrong with Mary Be Kitchen!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I ordered salmon, asparagus salad, grilled avocado and cauliflower. I hope this was all 100% organic as it was quite expensive. The salmon was ok but a very small portion. The avocado was fine. The cauliflower didn't taste fresh and was sweet and too greasy for my liking. I asked to be contacted if anything had grain in it. The asparagus salad had quinoa but I wasn't contacted, so I can't eat that. $, ok-ish meal was way too much. Needs to be fresher and more refined flavours with less grease (though the asparagus salad did look nice and fresh). It'd be really helpful if all ingredients were listed under the dishes so customers can choose appropriately. I won't order again. I can get fresher, less greasy from Impact Kitchen.","Sentiment":"positive"}

On a whim, we decided to order in BBQ, and I'm sure glad we did. Pig Out BBQ has succulent brisket, warm crumbly cornbread and coleslaw with a vinegary pop. This is more than enough for me, but we also had a toddler and a vegetarian in our crew, so Pig Out BBQ had to bring more heat than that, and it delivered. Excellent mac and cheese, decent salad and chicken tender and fries. Find me a child that doesn't like chicken tenders and fries and you've found me a liar. A liar!","Sentiment":"negative"}

{"Review Text":"Always delightful to have my pizza quick and fresh from any of these locations in the city. I usually go to the Dundas and Keele location and have lovely service everytime. (I feel the need to say this as I was sitting inside today at this location and someone decided to come in with nothing to show for, no receipt, order info or payment info complaining about service from the day before and they wouldn't leave. They complained why they weren't getting what they wanted at no cost with no proof when no one was sitting inside. Ignoring the fact, they literally walked right by me sitting down and listening to the whole thing the whole time until they left with a pizza I don't think she paid for). Remember that these employees need these jobs and are running  these places the best they can. I was going to stand up and say something towards this customer not being fair whatsoever when the person working there was doing the best they could to help and better the situation. No need to contact customer service when you know you're in the wrong). Please be kind! It doesn't cost anything and if you're ever unhappy about a service, just provide the necessary things they need to help you out back, simple. Everyone is doing the best they can at their jobs.

On the side of each tasting box also includes green and red seaweed salad and edamame. Presentation wise, it was so aesthetic. The handrolls both came wrapped with plastic so the seaweed wouldn't get soggy. My favorite pieces were the spicy salmon and zesty shrimp. I would definitely recommend trying this place!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I've been here a couple of times and both occasions we ordered their \"tasting box\". It had increased in price over the last couple of years and now valued at $25.99\/box ($29.). The last time I went was before the pandemic and it was more worth the value when it was priced cheaper. The tasting box included: seaweed salad, edamame, , lobster handroll, and tuna handroll. The torch pressed sushi was pretty good and each piece had a unique flavour to it. Torching the sushi definitely elevated the flavours with a smoky taste. The hand rolls were just okay in my opinion - I wish there was more lobster\/tuna in the roll, it had a lot of rice and I didn't taste the tuna\/lobster as much. Although, it was nice that they separated the seaweed from the rice so that it stayed crisp and not soggy after sitting in the box. The box was high quality and separated the meal nicely. I do wish the box came with a side of soup to make it a completed meal like how most sushi places offer as a \"combo\". I came here for take out but they do have some limited seating if you want to dine in.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"(Note: review is for delivery) Torch promises : fresh premium fish, topnotch sushi rice, and a unique aburi experience. I have to say, they generally are true to their word. I got the Tasting Box delivered, and it consisted of ,  (lobster and toro), seaweed salad and edamame. The aburi was good quality and variety. No duplicates here! My quibbles would be the rice fell apart very easily, and while most were fresh, there was one that tasted not like the others (not in a bad way, just in a not-the-same-quality way). But overall, the press and torch brought out the richness of the fish. It took me awhile to figure out how to get the handrolls out of their wrapping haha (dazed with hunger much?), but once I did, I thought they were a delight. While I would have liked more of the filling, both the lobster and toro rolls were good. The rice was nicely sticky and the nori was super crispy. Sounds crazy, but I actually enjoyed them more than the aburi sushi. Seaweed salad and edamame were good complements as their tastes cut through the richness of the sushi. Overall a bit pricey for the amount, but worth a try for the quality and variety you get.","Sentiment":"positive"}

Highlights of the tasting box for me were definitely the red seaweed salad, the lobster hand roll, and the torch pressed sushi with cheese (forgot which one this was specifically in the picture). For those wondering, the tasting box was just the right amount of food - I was definitely full after eating despite having some initial doubts. Since this was a tasting box, I found myself savouring each bite of the torch sushi and cleansing my pallet with ginger after each sushi. A great experience and I'd definitely come back again.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I've only ordered takeout from here. If you're like me, most delivery food tastes like guilt and depression after you come to the realization that you will never be able to financially recover at this rate (I'm over dramatic I know). I know I have a problem- 9\/. Why do I keep ordering delivery anyways? Because 1\/, and a hit of dopamine that keeps me hooked. *insert clown emoji here* I'm also a sucker for good packaging and I feel that nicely packaged and presented sushi makes it taste even better. In all seriousness- Torch Sushi is pretty good value in my opinion, and the quality has been consistent. There's two negatives I can think of however: - Handrolls aren't as good as the Torched sushi- the Toro sushi doesn't taste fresh either, it's got a fishy taste (which I know sounds contradictory but fresh fish doesn't taste fishy) - Some of the Torched sushi is completely cooked through... not sure if they intentionally do this but I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be cooked all the way through I keep ordering from here because honestly I don't know what is it about food delivery that makes most food taste horrible to me, but Torch sushi hasn't disappointed me to that level and has been consistently good.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"It's been several years since I've returned to this place (first time post Covid fiasco) & I'm so glad I did. I forgot how much I loved this place after trying dozens of other ramen. I visited twice in one week! I came here on a Thursday night and waited  (we didn't make reservations). On Saturday I made reservations for two. It tends to be busy during dinner service but I find the tables open up faster than you think which means service is good. Anyways I ordered the Rich Gyokai tsukemen (dipping style) which was heavenly for me. The whole concept is that your concentrated broth is in a small bowl and your freshly made noodles are in another. You dip your noodles into your broth. This allows maximum control of how much flavour (or sodium haha) you consume. You can soak the noodles a few seconds longer if you want it to absorb more of the broth. You can get the noodles either hot or cold. Both are equally good for me (I tried both). If you're feeling hot, get the cold noodle - it's more refreshing. Anyways, once you're done dipping, you ask them for more broth to pour into your small bowl so that the concentrated version is now diluted and drinkable. So much umami flavour! It comes with diced pork belly but I like to order $. I am always extremely full after this meal. The noodles are freshly made because they're not perfectly shaped and are textured which allows them to be coated and hold onto the sauce better. I do wish they were thinner though. My friends and partner ordered the ramen soup version of mine: Gyokai tonkotsu shoyu ramen. They all loved it. I also loved it because I ate from their bowls both times. It's waves of umami with every slurp. They all preferred it over the dipping style because it's more flavour and less work each time. End of the day: the dipping style ramen is more interactive and gives you more control over your food. And the soup ramens are more flavourful with each mouthful as they are already soaked. My partner was so impressed with his ramen that he can't wait to come back. We'd love to try their appetizers. Drinks: yuzu soda (cold version, non alcoholic) and ume blossom cocktail are both tasty. The ume blossom is dangerous because you don't taste the alcohol. I wanted to chug it. So good!","Sentiment":"positive"}

But my friend ordered the hakata tonkatsu ramen and it came with thin noodles. Egg is $. My fav part of the bowl was the pork - which was super tender and had a good proportion of meat to fat. I found a piece of hair in my ramen. My server apologized and brought a new one, and even took off 50% on that dish. I appreciate how the staff handled the situation. Overall the ramen is alright here, but I don't think it's up to par compared with the other more popular ramen joints.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I had the pad kee mau \"drunken\" noodle. It was delicious and I would highly recommend. The dish was very flavourful with a little bit of spiciness to it that I gobbled up the whole plate.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"This Thai restaurant has been on my list to check out for a long time. Unfortunately I do not visit the East End, therefore was never in the area. Luckily I was able to check this place out this past weekend! We started with the taro rolls and the crispy morning glory with golden pumpkin soup. I was sad to see that there was only one crispy morning glory on the dish. Thankfully the golden pumpkin soup was absolutely delicious and made up for the lack of fritter quantity. Since it was the first time, we ordered the chefs pad Thai to try. On the waiters recommendation we also ordered the braised curry lamb with peach. We were blown away by the curry lamb, such depth of flavor, tender meat, sweetness from the peach and a gentle growing heat with each bite. Unfortunately, the pad Thai was bland in comparison. We fix the issue by adding the curry to the pad Thai and enjoying it together. Would go back for the curry lamb alone!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"I really like this Thai restaurant, all foods are delicious and bring me the feeling when I visited Thailand before Also, both owner & chef welcome guests like old friends, that's why I came with friends 2nd times within few days","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Randomly stumbled upon this place after seeing it had good reviews, I went in on a Wednesday night and were seated immediately. We started with the Royal Thai Lobster Soup, served in a coconut. The soup was so delicious. We also ordered the Sasi's pad Thai which was delectable, melted in my mouth. Then we got the red chicken curry that came in a pineapple. Also ordered the lychee martini which was amazing. Overall, highly recommend this place, The presentation of their food was like no other restaurant. The service was delightful, and owner Allen was very nice.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"I attended a corporate cooking class event here.  It involved breaking into groups of 3--, then congregating for a family style dinner (with food made by the chef).  We all had a great time and the food (made by the chef) was delicious! I felt like the night could have been a bit more organized - there was some waiting around, and shuffling from one place to another around the restaurant.  However, I appreciated how much attention we got from who I believe was the owner and his family, and I left with a full stomach and full heart.  I love the family-run-business\/hole-in-the-wall vibe, and I would go back again.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Must visit ! I was not expecting such a serene ambience. It's like you've been transported out of the city. So cozy with dinner over candle light. One downside is the bathroom which needs upgrades ASAP. We over estimated the amount we should order for two and ended up with enough food to feed an army. Portions are VERY generous! Keep that in mind. My highlights were the lemongrass soup and sasi curry. 10\/10. Such complex flavours that hit you in different ways each time you take another taste. The soup was perfect for the bitterly cold weather. The service was exceptional and the owner came by to greet us and share fun stories ( and photos!) of his very famous guests. 10\/10. The menu is a bit overwhelming as it contains numerous dishes you are not used to seeing at a Thai restaurant. They are clearly focused on expanding our Thai palate and moving us beyond our comfort zones. For example there's a grilled fish dish cooked with tamarind that I want to try next time. I'm already planning to return and especially to try the dessert menu. Lemongrass creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e any one!?? I can't wait ! Fantastic spot just east of the core and absolutely perfect and intimate for a date night.","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Authentic sushi very fresh very good. It's pricy (which is why I gave ) but you get what you pay for. Everything is a notch above. The hand rolls aren't cones they're open at both ends. Don't lose your stuff out the bottom!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"My favourite non-omakase sushi in the city. Visit Yuzuki for an authentic Japanese experience with excellent sushi, seasonal dishes and great service. The sake list is also extensive and staff are very helpful. I always order the premium sushi set and usually try one of their special appetizers and am never disappointed. They even use real wasabi! Chef Akira is attentive and friendly. I can't wait to go back!","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Dropped in for a quick dinner only to be met with the sweetest waitresses and better dressed patrons. Service and food was attentive and good. We ordered a dinner set and some side salads and nigiri and every single mouthful was delicious. Yuzuki is great for a quiet dinner date with really fresh ingredients.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Small nondescript Japanese restaurant on Bloor Street east side of yonge. The website shows authentic Japanese food so I was definitely motivated tot try! Called at . Small zen like interior space. Menu has typical traditional items. There is a daily special for seasonal items. We ordered the premium sushi set, Japanese fried oysters ( from Japan ), California snow crab roll, tamago sushi and teriyaki salmon dinner. The fish tasted quite fresh in the premium sushi set. Tango and California roll nicely done. Didn't really like the fried oyster heavy on breading and tasted like a regular oyster. Salmon teriyaki standard. For this price  this restaurant falls short of expectations compared to other authentic Japanese restaurants. For me this restaurant didn't really impress and this is a .","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Yuzuki's hamachi kama shio-yaki ($13.50) was brilliantly done, the skin on the fish grilled until crispy with the meat flaking off and moist. There's that delicious meatiness on the first bite that you just want to savour. Fish jaws can be delightful. In quick succession the premium sushi set ($57) arrives with -toro roll that's created from fish flown in from Japan. Each piece was deftly prepared and small enough to be consumed in one-bite or savoured with two smaller nibbles. The lightly warmed rice could have been seasoned more but had a nice consistency - not too densely packed yet compressed enough that it held up being handled. The pieces of hirame, kanpachi, Hamachi, madai, and jin-kinmedai, were all light on the palette choices. Ideally, with -fish protein to create a greater contrast in flavours. There was a trio of tuna (oma akami, chu-toro, and o-toro) that's typical in a premium sushi set. All were good except the o-toro contained a chewy bit, so I didn't experience that sought after melt-in-your-mouth effect.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Lunch plans with colleagues hit a snag when the spot we intended to visit was packed, so we headed to libretto as our plan b. Around 12:20pm on a Wednesday it was about 3\/. We were in a hurry by now, so we all ordered the special. Can't recall the name, but it was a thin crust with Gorgonzola cheese and...peaches! Word?? (Chappelle voice). It was delicious. I was starving. So I checked with my colleagues and they also gave a fairly enthusiastic thumbs up. And our bills were all under $. Not bad! Maybe next time we'll come back as a plan a.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Great pizzas and service, wished they had their carpaccio still, my friend highly recommended that and I really wanted to try it :( hope you bring it back","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Delicious pizza and great craft beers! I've been to this specific location a couple times now but I've also had food from their university location as well. Servers are always friendly and polite. They have a great list of craft beers on tap and ciders. My favourite thing here is their house made sausage pizza with the chili oil. Dipping the pizza into a plate of that chili oil one of the greatest pleasures in life. Would totally recommend for group settings (as my boyfriend has had his birthday party here already once) or just for a casual hang out.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"Pizza was not bad. Service was non-existent. Someone need to retrain Alex because she forgot how to serve and or check in on her table of customers. Place wasn't even busy. We waited almost 't bother or remember to bring us a single refill of water. I kind of felt bad for the . By the time we finished our () pizza and paid our bill they still haven't received their food. I was telling my friend that I should order a UberEats pizza to drop it off on the patio because they took forever and didn't even tell us why it was taking so long! I am not sure why I bother leaving a tip, but consider I was little generous that they just reopen for patio. I will not return to this location.","Sentiment":"positive"}
{"Review Text":"came during happy hour so it's not too busy. - happy hour calamari - smaller portion for $8, great to share between . flavour was OK and the sauce tasted like a sweet puree - happy hour meatballs - smaller portion also for $8. We thought the meatballs were a bit dry but the ricotta cheese and tomato sauce saved the dish. Nothing special about the . - margherita pizza - neopolitan style, I love the thin chewy crust. Safe option to choose. Pizza is big enough to share between . Service was great, price was reasonable and the atmosphere was quite cozy and intimate for a pizzeria. I would definitely come back for their pizza!","Sentiment":"positive"}

{"Review Text":"Came here with a large group of friends (), and I have to say, the service was impeccable! The waiter was super attentive, however I must note that the restaurant wasn't very busy that evening (it was a Monday night). We got to try a lot of different items on the menu since we had such a large table. Salumi e formaggi: meat and cheese plate, this was pretty good, I really liked the breadsticks that came with it! Arugula salad: I really enjoyed the salad, but I wish there was more pears in it! There were barely any. Arancini: Italian risotto balls, these tasted great with the tomato sauce. It's super cheesy inside and I can see it being a super popular menu item. Would recommend! Gnocchi: surprisingly, this was my favourite dish of the night and I usually don't like gnocchi! I found the creamy sauce to be delicious and the texture just right. Prosciutto & arugula pizza, funghi pizza, & diavola pizza: to be honest, I wasn't a huge fan of the pizza. The flavor for all of them just wasn't there, and I don't think there was enough sauce so I found all the pizzas to be really dry. Since this is a pizza place, I was pretty disappointed with the quality of the pizza.... Overall the meal was pretty average, I can't see myself being a regular customer here, but I'm glad I tried it with a large group so we could try so many different dishes.","Sentiment":"positive"}
