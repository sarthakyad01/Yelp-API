              " \"My friend and I wanted to catch up over dinner on a Saturday evening, and she picked this place (as she read great reviews). We didn't have a reservation, so we waited in line and the friendly staff at the front took down one of our names. Then we were informed that it would be about 30 minute wait and were asked to wait until our name was called. While waiting, we looked around- the vibe was energetic and fun, the customers were eating and laughing. The decor was cool- the lights were dimmed, there were various colourful objects all around to evoke a comfy feel. I thought the place was pretty small, until our name was called and we were led to a table by a friendly young lady. The place was huge- there were multiple sections and each section had its own decor! Our seat was at the end section, where the decor reminded us of sitting inside someone's home. Our server was a second friendly young lady. She warmly greeted us and showed us the menu (QR code). She said she'll be back to take our order in a few minutes. To start, we ordered Shrimp Chips and two Thai Ice Tea. For the main, I picked Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken. My friend chose Khao Soi with beef. A few minutes later, the Shrimp Chips and two Thai Ice Tea came to us. The Shrimp Chips were delicious- they were crispy and lightly salty. The Thai Ice Tea was tasty- it tasted like milk tea with deeper tea flavour. Then our mains came and we couldn't wait to eat! For my meal, the blend of veggies, chewy noodles, and the chicken pieces were delicious- however it was a bit salty. My friend enjoyed her meal as well- she said that she liked the smooth coconut curry with blend of spices and the juicy pieces of beef. Throughout our meal, our server came by to check-in on us to make sure that we had everything we needed. The portions were generous and the dishes and drinks were delicious! Highly recommended!\",\n",
              " \"- excellent chips! - pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with 5 pieces of shrimp - fried shrimp was excellent - really good pineapple juice The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks. Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless. Shame there was no thai iced coffee.\",\n",
              " \"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #1 way too crowded inside. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #2 we got a high table with tall stools for our dining experience. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #3 we ordered pork skewers as app. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #4 I noticed that the food came out less than lukewarm. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #5 order Thai spicy. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy. On the positive side the server was good. Don't know if I would return.\",\n",

Do yourself a favor and make a dang reservation or be prepared for a thirty to forty-five minute wait.',\n",
              " 'Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy. We are group of 5. Ordered Food: # THAI CHICKEN WINGS # GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters ) # MOO PING (grilled pork skewers) # GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken) # GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef) # PAD SEE EW (Shrimp) Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli). The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick. The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as \"wow\". Drinks (Cocktails) # GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.) # THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower) # RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime) All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick. The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!']"

              " 'Friday night dinner. Tried to book 2 weeks in advance but there was no table available for reservations. They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy. We are group of 5. Ordered Food: # THAI CHICKEN WINGS # GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters ) # MOO PING (grilled pork skewers) # GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken) # GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef) # PAD SEE EW (Shrimp) Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli). The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick. The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as \"wow\". Drinks (Cocktails) # GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.) # THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower) # RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime) All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick. The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!']"

We didn't have a reservation, so we waited in line and the friendly staff at the front took down one of our names. Then we were informed that it would be about 30 minute wait and were asked to wait until our name was called. While waiting, we looked around- the vibe was energetic and fun, the customers were eating and laughing. The decor was cool- the lights were dimmed, there were various colourful objects all around to evoke a comfy feel. I thought the place was pretty small, until our name was called and we were led to a table by a friendly young lady. The place was huge- there were multiple sections and each section had its own decor! Our seat was at the end section, where the decor reminded us of sitting inside someone's home. Our server was a second friendly young lady. She warmly greeted us and showed us the menu (QR code). She said she'll be back to take our order in a few minutes. To start, we ordered Shrimp Chips and two Thai Ice Tea. For the main, I picked Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken. My friend chose Khao Soi with beef. A few minutes later, the Shrimp Chips and two Thai Ice Tea came to us. The Shrimp Chips were delicious- they were crispy and lightly salty. The Thai Ice Tea was tasty- it tasted like milk tea with deeper tea flavour. Then our mains came and we couldn't wait to eat! For my meal, the blend of veggies, chewy noodles, and the chicken pieces were delicious- however it was a bit salty. My friend enjoyed her meal as well- she said that she liked the smooth coconut curry with blend of spices and the juicy pieces of beef.

The waiting area is very small, most of my family had to stand. I ordered the chaing Mai beef noodle soup, they give you a good amount of meat, and it was very flavorful. I tried my boyfriend's Khao soi (chicken and noodles in coconut milk curry) and it was so creamy, it the best thing I had eaten all month. I recommend dining here, and definitely make a reservation ahead of time.\",\n",
              " \"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened! We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy! Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick. I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too! I also wish this place had more variety of food items since it didn't feel like much variety when I went.\",\n",
              " 'Hubby and I saw this place on YouTube\\'s \"Worth It\" and we were curious and had to try this place out. Is it all hype or is it \"Worth It?\" I loved the Mango Slaw as I found it refreshing. I loved the textures of the sweetness of the mangos with the crunchiness of the taro sticks and peanuts. It is a must get, in my book. Hubby and I decided to go vegetarian for our entrees. Hubby ordered Tofu Pad Gra Prow which was very good while I ordered Tofu Khao Soi. There was a perfect balance between the curry and soup. The harmonious coconut milk with the stock made it the standout dish with its refreshing combination of flavors and textures. I truly appreciate the notion that they offer plenty of vegetarian food and can make any dish vegan. This is a trendy place and you should make reservations on Friday nights as well as the weekends. The service was fast and efficient. They offer dinner specials but the waitress explained everyone at the table would have to order it in order for it to come into effect. The ambiance with live bands on weekends and the overall trendy atmosphere adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the dining experience. So the question remains, \"Is it Worth It?\" The answer is unequivocally, \"YES!\" It definitely lived up to the hype for us.',\n",
              " 'I was in Toronto attending the annual TIFF film festival, and dined at this restaurant on my birthday. I wanted a nice meal and a break from all the movies, and the large crowd hanging around out front and the hour-long wait for a table reassured me that this was going to be a tasty meal. I put my name on the list and waited for a text that my table was ready. (The hostess asked if we would be okay sitting at a communal table, so be aware if you\\'re super private and would prefer to dine alone). The restaurant is in a basement, so it\\'s very dark and intimate inside. It is packed with tables, so you\\'ll run a gauntlet to get to your table. The atmosphere is casual and lively, and it\\'s very loud inside with concrete floors and walls. The decor is casual and fun, with colorful flags adorning the walls and a large bar in the center. Since it was my birthday, we decided to order a bottle of prosecco that was listed on the menu. The friendly server took that order and disappeared, only to return to say they didn\\'t have any bottles of prosecco, and we\\'d have to order by the glass. Big disappointment. We placed our order for Thai vegetables as an appetizer and we each got their house specialty: Pad Thai. I chose shrimp, my husband chose beef. Our server typed our orders into his electronic pad and disappeared for the remainder of our meal. The place was packed and they obviously didn\\'t have enough servers waiting tables, so the service knocks this place down at least one, but probably two, stars. Another thing that really bugged me is that we were charged prices that were higher than what was stated on the menu. I am not sure if this was just the \"tourist surprise special\" or if they have dynamic pricing during special events downtown, but it rubbed me the wrong way. My prosecco per-glass price was almost three dollars more than listed on the menu, as were our entrees. Not cool. I also was annoyed by the volume of noise in the place. It was SO LOUD with people screaming to have conversations. This would\\'ve been a killer place for a romantic evening if they could do something about the noise levels. The food was really good and made with high quality ingredients, so I can\\'t complain about that at all! In fact, I\\'ll definitely return next time I\\'m in town for the festival. Note: they won\\'t take reservations during TIFF, so don\\'t bother. But do show up at least an hour before you want to eat, it really did take the quoted time for a table to be ready.',\n",

We were fine with it. Food was mostly great except for the suckling pig that was not suckling pig to me, the Chinese and my guest who is British Indian & lived in Asia. We get the skin was crispy but the pork itself was ham - nothing else would remind us of suckling pig. We much preferred the beans and sides that came with it. Everything else we had were delicious. From the the duck confit app, gem salad, mushroom app, and spiced sticky toffee pudding was praised by the British guest who enjoyed this version of their national dessert. They had sufficient staff checking on us throughout the evening that were always friendly. The time we did need them to take our food / drink order we did have to wait (awkward). Overall we had a very pleasant dinner catch up there.',\n",

              " \"Came by for dinner the other night and it was a decent experience. Richmond Station didn't make the latest Michelin guide and I think I know why... My last two visits for lunch were excellent. Made a reservation for the 2.5 hour tasting menu 45 days in advance for the Chef's table. It was originally priced at $105 and was bumped for $140 a couple of weeks prior to dining. The chef's tasting menu is framed as a testing menu for potential new dishes on the permanent menu moving forward. Service is included with all prices and merely tax is needed. Tipping is discouraged. Staff were talented, in uniform. Some also wore a mask and gloves. The dining room is tightly packed and is quite casual, despite being located right in the middle of downtown Toronto. Parking is available in paid garages nearby. Started off with the selection of canapes and it was extremely well presented. From a taste perspective, it was lacking in terms of flavor... The tomatoes course was also mediocre. The shrimp were tiny and the anchovies were extremely salty. The presentation was good. The soy marinated hen's egg was also another miss. The egg was extremely salty while the sides were well presented. For the mains, had a tasting portion of the halibut and it was world class. The halibut was perfectly grilled unskinned and deboned. The inside of the halibut was perfectly moist and juicy. The side of peas and foam were all spot on. The bread course was also excellent. The bread was soft, baked to perfection, topped with butter and served with a side of butter. The dry aged duck breast course was also decent. Perfectly grilled duck breast cooked to a perfect medium pink on the inside and served with a side of mushrooms which were grilled to perfection. The deconstructed strawberry shortcake was mediocre. Wasn't a big fan, although the fresh Ontario strawberries were a great touch. The final course of petit fours were unfortunately a disaster. They were extremely sweet. The mini boston creme donut didn't taste too fresh either... ~$155/head for a tasting menu dinner after tax with service included.\",\n",

Service by the staff was over the top to the perfection making the experience super comfortable! Ordered the Station Burger which was phenomenal! Patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare and even featured short rib inside the burger! The bun was very fresh! The fries looked simple and they tasted heavenly! ...will have to make another visit the next time I'm in town to try out their dinner! ~$30/head after tax and gratuity for lunch.\",\n",
              " \"Wow! Just wow! This place is amazing. We ordered the following dishes and did not leave disappointed. The following are rated based on favorite to least favorite: 1. Roasted Suckling Pig-this dish contained crispy pork belly and a piece of pork shoulder served with a variety of veggies. Wow, this was the best pork that my SO and I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, tender, and seasoned. We almost licked the plate. 2. Chicken Fried Oyster Mushroom-this dish came with perfectly battered mushrooms that tasted filling like protein. The perfect amount of Mayo and sesame seeds to finish. 3. Penokean Hills Beef Tartare-this tartare was well seasoned and came with Bibb lettuce. There needed to be more lettuce but flavors were excellent. 4. Duck Liver Pate-this dish was served with brioche which was a bit too thick and dry to accompany the pate. A lighter bread ursThe pate itself is flavorful and texture-ful but the strong strawberry scent masked the taste of the dish itself. 5. Station Burger-voted Toronto's burger, this is a combination of sweet and savory with some sort of jam and Mayo with a perfectly cooked patty. Unfortunately, compared to everything else, this wasn't the best thing we've had. However, still solid! Service was excellent, and interior was nicely decorated. The meal itself comes with complimentary bread. The focaccia bread with cream and sunflower oil was also tasty. A little toasting of the bread and extra cream would have made it perfect.\",\n",

Having arrived five minutes early, they weren't ready to seat tables and we were asked to leave - no option to wait inside or at the bar, what a pain during a windy cold fall evening. Nonetheless, once we were seated, our waitress was warm and welcoming, making up for the poor first impression from the hostess. Luckily, the food didn't disappoint. The burrata e caviale ($45), although served a bit cold for my taste, was soft and fluffy, the centre creamy but doesn't ooze out upon being cut through. The simple starter was a cacophony of flavours mixing briny Italian caviar, sweet Asfodelo honey, and a smoky sourness from the Blackbird bread. That splash of sweetness from the honey was unexpected but absolutely made the dish. Pull apart the calamari ripieni con tonno ($36) before taking a bite and you'll find the delicate seafood stuffed with yellowfin tuna paste so there's a meatiness to each bite. It's topped with a puntarella and charred pepper salad, giving the calamari a refreshing crispy bite. I'm glad it wasn't overloaded with too many sauces so that the natural seafood flavours were present. In retrospect, the lorighittas al mare ($38) was too similar to the calamari. In fact, when the dish was presented, all I could see was a plate of squid rings, only to find many were circles of hand braided pasta. Our waitress explains what makes the dish special is the time intensive nature of creating the pasta, which did have a lovely bite to it. Everything is tossed in a tasty olive oil sauce with a hint of garlic, chilli, and an umami essence from anchovy. I just wish the dish had more of the bay scallops and even some spot prawns thrown in to make it taste more like a seafood pasta. I'm generally hesitant to order ravioli as it's usually a scant dish and when they are not adequately filled it can taste like you're eating pieces of dough. Osteria Giulia's ravioli doppi ($44) smartly has one side unsealed so they can be overstuffed with silky ricotta and sauce, so you get a gush of filling with each bite. Chunks of lobster and kernels of sweet corn add richness and texture to the dish. It was an impressive dish and the most memorable of the evening. This is a long review head to Gastro World for the rest.\",\n",
              " \"After having bookmarked this 1-star Michelin restaurant for far too long, I finally decided to try it. The two of us ordered a wide assortment of dishes, so much so that the regular who sat next to us applauded us for our courageous and seemingly bottomless appetites. Cavoletti - Brussels sprouts, smoked sardines, anchovy butter, pistachios. It was a unique pairing of textures and flavors. Interesting. I could appreciate the creativity behind the recipe. Polpo alla Griglia - Grilled octopus, smoked potato, soleggiati tomatoes, seaweed butter. While the octopus was tender and the dish was visually appealing, I found the blended flavors to be odd-tasting. Carre di Agnello - 8pc lamb rack, we asked for medium-rare. Came out more on the rare side and the meat was a little chewy. It was also lacking in flavour, carried only by the infused olive oil - the lamb could've used a lot more seasoning and char. Lorighittas al Mare - Hand-braided pasta, wild squid, bay scallops, chili, garlic, anchovy. Flavour was good and pasta was al dente. Unfortunate that the portions were rather small for $38. Spaghettoni ai Ricci Di Mare - Spaghetti, BC sea urchin, soleggiati tomatoes, pangrattato. I was most looking forward to this dish and most disappointed by it. Only 1-2 pieces of uni atop an otherwise uninspiring base. Though orange in color, the sauce did not taste of uni and instead, was completely overwhelmed by cheesiness. I got sick of its single-tone flavour and heaviness by my last bite. Overall, did I appreciate the dining experience and culinary innovation? For the most part, yes. Would I say there were any dishes that were memorable and that I would crave again? Unfortunately, no.\",\n",
              " \"Upscale Italian fare with impeccable service, food and ambiance. Came here for a special occasion on a Monday with resos. 5pm. It was bumpin'. Full house. Space is loud so be ready to talk over other tables. Food: Focaccia di recco - flatbread stuffed with cheese and sea salt.  Probably one of my favorite dishes. Can't go wrong with cheese and bread. Vitello tonnato - veal carpaccio with crème fresh and capers. Meaty, creamy, delicious. Spaghetti ai Ricci di mare - sea urchin (uni) pasta - what a delight. Rich and creamy uni in a carbonara type sauce. The level of concentrated flavor in this dish is unmatched. Frutti di mare alla griglia - grilled seafood platter for two. Octopus, monk fish, White Sea bass, jumbo prawn, tiger prawn, scallops. Great for sharing or even eat it yourself if you want to indulge. Excellent variety as each one was cooked differently from the other. The monk fish skin was a little tough though. Not a meal I can eat daily otherwise I would die from the richness of the dishes Overall good experience. Would come again. No parking, look for street parking on Bernard street or Davenport. 4.5/5\",\n",
              " \"My sister and her partner took me here for my birthday. I heard you have to make book a table 2 weeks in advance, and they're closed on Thursdays. I was excited to try this restaurant; they received a one Michelin star,and they're known for their seafood dishes. It is a must to get their focaccia bread! It's completely different than a normal focaccia bread we're familiar with. It's basically a flat bread with melted cheese and it was delicious. Their branzino was the best dish of the night as well as their clam pasta. The seafood is all cooked to perfection. The service was good, and the ambiance of the place was modern and clean. Their calamari pasta was unique because the pasta is braided; however, I prefer the clam pasta. Next time, I would try their seafood platter. I heard the platter is amazing! Overall, an amazing night and great way to celebrate my birthday.\",\n",

A visit to the restroom led to an encounter with a well dressed entourage of women complaining about other patrons.  The seating felt tight, but not in a warm way.  The vibe was Toronto Life magazine. Maybe it's that we didn't feel like guests. I can't quite figure out why. It's a shame as we were really looking forward to this dinner.

You can easily find something as good or better in Toronto. Even the flatbread that they had a long description for on the menu, it was very underwhelming. Decor - We were a group of 5 and were seated in the back, in a section that has a lower ceiling. The design of it was not very smart as the echo of the restaurant / noise from other tables was so loud that I could not carry a conversation with my friends without yelling. I could barely hear the server introducing the menu to us. I will however say that star of the night was the tiramisu. It was one of the best ones I have tasted so I will give them that. However, again, I would expect much more (not just one amazing dessert) from them and the experience was a bit disappointing.',\n",

The black truffle rice is the priciest side but definitely something you would have a hard time finding elsewhere. Just get it. Short rib kebab very tender and better size than I anticipated.

We called ahead and left a voice message as our crew decided to head over after work on Friday night for a happy hour/small plate dinner. Upon arrival, we were informed that they do not take reservations over the phone and that we would have had to make them via Open Table. When I looked at the restaurant's website, the reservations tab did not indicate that reservations were only taken through Open Table. In fact, I could not find the link for Open Table on the web page. We were seated upstairs at the bar and the bar tender was out of this world great. I ordered the Mediterrean Mule without the honey. He was very accommodating and after I disclosed my food allergies, he would not let me dig into my plat of maple roasted beets until he verified that the glaze had no honey in it. After the initial snafu at the door, the experience was great, the company was outstanding, and the food was great.

For the price point, food items were small and all came out cold in temperature. The dip with the bread was alright but they could have given more bread since we had lots of dip leftover to use with other food. The beef dishes were a disappointment. The worse was the pide which was burned!!! Nothing much stood out. The company was the best part as we tried this restaurant. I wouldn't go back.\",\n",

Our dishes included the Roasted Red Beats, Turkish Manti Dumplings, Fried Egg Plant, Whole Middle Easter Fried Chicken, and finishing with Baclava. Every dish was fantastic, but if I had to choose it's the dumplings and fried egg plant. The serving portions were just the right amount for two.

The sunchoke and truffle salad is a great starter - and helps cut through any of the heavier dishes.  The octopus and manti are solid but not as \"wow\" as the short rib. The staff are very helpful and friendly - and the food comes pretty quickly.  Seating is also spacious and comfortable in a dimly-lit ambiance.  Worth a visit!',\n",

The fried olives were delightful bites. The labneh was absolutely fabulous-smooth, creamy and with a punch. The seeded bread served alongside was dynamite. We also got the eggplant dumplings and the yogurt sauce spiked with the sweet date sauce was heavenly. We also shared the short ribs and the greens and cauliflower. These were not quite as stand out as our 1st round of share plates. Highly recommend this restaurant. Definitely some if the best bites we had in Toronto.

In this case, my phone did not eat first. The aroma of the freshly cut herbs, Parmesan cheese, and homemade marinara sauce were an absolute seller. For my main course, I ordered the Calamrai aka Griglia. This was the dish that sold my experience. The Mediterranean seasoning had the perfect amount of salt that coupled well with the squid.

              " 'Decided to splurge and celebrate a birthday here. For a fine dining experience, where apparently many celebrities like to go, this place was so very disappointing! They must either serve the \"rich and famous\" something completely different or the \"rich and famous\" have no concept of what excellent food is. Our server was fantastic; however, you could tell they were very short staffed as he and the busboy were very hurried. When our server came to our table, he was very friendly and wonderful. Too bad he did not come by that often. He did mention that they were short staffed and that the kitchen was very busy. A few times the busboy would almost throw our cutlery down on the table when resetting for the next course. He was also not consistent in setting down the cutlery. Knives facing different directions for each person or spoons on different sides of the knife or fork. Normally I would not care that much but when I go to a fine dining restaurant, I expect to receive a fine dining experience. The main reason for coming here was to have exceptional Italian food. The food itself was mostly good but it wasn\\'t mind blowing in anyway and did not inspire us to to come back. Especially not for the prices this place was charging. Here\\'s what we had: * Frittura Mista Di Pesce- Buttermilk-battered and deep fried shrimp and calamari with tartare sauce - the oil was clean and everything was fresh. It\\'s deep fried calamari and shrimp, nothing overly complicated. * Polpo Alla Puttanesca - Grilled octopus served with cherry tomatoes from Pachino, black olives, anchovies and capers from Pantelleria - the octopus was grilled well and not over done. The tomatoes were nice and fresh. It was good but not the best I\\'ve had. * Carpaccio Di Filetto Di Manzo Con Tartufo Nero Di Norcia E Stracciatella Di Burrata - Tomatoes with fresh black truffle from Norcia and burrata Stracciatella cheese - one of the most disappointing dishes! The Burrata was served to us too cold and the creamy centre wasn\\'t creamy at all. Made me wonder if we even got Burrata or if we got Mozzarella. There is a difference! * Fettuccine Alla Bolognese Di Mamma Laura - \"Little Ribbon\" fettucine with Mamma\\'s famous fresh homemade meat sauce - simple dish of pasta noodles with meat sauce. It was quite bland. I think the kitchen forgot the salt. * La Carbonara - Artisanal Zaccagni spaghetti tossed with crispy pork cheek from Amatrice, eggs, Sarawak black pepper and Roman *DOP Pecorino cheese - the sauce on this dish was  well seasoned and quite delicious! However, the spaghetti was undercooked. It wasn\\'t al dente, it was undercooked. When we finally had a chance to tell the server, he explained how the pasta chef is \"Roman\" and how the Romans feel this is how pasta should be cooked. He even mentioned that he\\'s had many debates about this with the chef in the past. Basically we were served undercooked pasta on purpose. He suggested that next time we should let them know that we want our pasta al dente, the Italian way. Seriously? If you know this is what your kitchen is going to do, then you should inform your customers at the time of ordering. * Bistecca Alla Brace - Grilled Prime Canadian striploin with mushrooms au jus - nice huge juicy steak with a good amount of sides but nothing super special. * Costoletta Di Vitello - Grilled white provimi veal chop - tender and juicy; however, another dish served under season. Since our table was sharing everything, the kitchen cut the veal for us. * Cheesecake with fresh fruit compote, strawberry Tiramisu, Classic Italian Tiramisu, Ricotta Cheesecake with Pears and Almond Crust - the highlight of the dinner! All the desserts were delicious and presented beautifully on one large plate. Our favourite was the Ricotta Cheesecake with Pears and Almond Crust. All in all, the food was good but did not meet expectations. Since the kitchen was so slow and we were getting really hungry, we only told our server about the food experience we had after eating. There are so many other wonderful places you can go to great Italian food and a fine dining experience. This was not one of them. If you have money to burn and are into chance celebrity sightings (which we did not care about), go ahead and come here. If you want consistent, impeccable service and food that would make you want to come back the next day, go somewhere else.',\n",
              " \"Such a disappointing meal and honestly so embarrassed that I suggested this place to my friends. The carbonara was probably one of the worst we have had. It was the one pasta dish our server suggested, 3 of us got it. The carbonara was so salty, cheesy and the pasta was so undercooked. We also suspect it to be cream base because it was so saucy, almost like soup. It was awful. We all had a few bites and left 3/4 of the plate untouched. We ordered the calamari and shrimp to start. It was fresh and pretty good. The bread was also not bad, nothing special. The service was average, our server seemed annoyed explaining the specials to us. Mid way telling us the specials, he asked if we are really interested in knowing the specials... He was quick at refilling our waters. That's probably because they don't offer tap water. So we were suckered into buying bottled water. We spent $40 on water alone, for four people. It's an expensive meal, which I'm honestly ok paying, if it's a good meal. This was not worth it at all, and I don't recommend.\",\n",

All three were great, but the slaw was the unanimous favorite. It was so light and fresh with lots of textures and, even with so many ingredients, tasted excellent all together. The cheeseburger spring rolls were the weakest in my opinion, but not to say they weren't good. Just not as flavorful as the other plates. They had a 2.5 oz A5 Miyazaki Wagyu on special so I ordered that because I've always wanted to try Miyazaki Wagyu. It did not disappoint! The price was surprisingly fair ($65 CAD/$50 USD) for such a stellar cut of meat. The smaller portion was still filling, especially since the meat is so rich. Melted in my mouth and was worth every bit the hype. It came with pickled radish (a favorite of mine), parmesan frites, and daikon with mustard. Every bite was so flavorful and I left very satisfied. We also split the All Time Favorites dessert tasting plate (eight pieces) and it was more than enough for us all. My favorite was the tong yuen, it tasted like a fancy (and much better) Asian-inspired Ferrero Rocher. Sometimes restaurants from famous chefs don't live up to the hype, but Lee definitely does. Susur Lee is truly a magician and I'm so glad I was able to finally try his dishes. Our server, Quinn, was also excellent.

The burrata tasted Italian (couldn't detect any Chinese influence) but really delicious, a flavorful pesto. The tofu was really good but probably not super unique, I've had similar tofu at other places. The only dish we didn't love was the vegetarian curry, we felt it was lacking flavor and difficult to eat since the paratha had wet things on it like a flatbread, so you could use it to properly scoop up the curry. But mainly the flavor was just kind of one note, not a ton of deep savory flavor. The decor in the new location wasn't right up my alley but definitely very unique and overall a nice vibe. I'm docking a star because they made us wait over 30min for our table and we had a reservation. There were a ton of people waiting and zero standing room so for 30+ min we were all basically pressed against each other and getting shoved as if we were at a club. It's been 3-4months but almost seemed like it was opening day with how much of a mess they were, all the staff was super panicked and disorganized.

              " \"I went here for a company Christmas dinner, so the experience might have been slightly enhanced due to the higher budget but regardless, I had a great time and the food was absolutely delicious. We got a private room in the back and it had a really nice set up with a large table seating 20+ people. I had actually gotten surgery the day before, so I was on some medication's and had some trouble walking around but luckily the staff were very attentive to me and took good care of me. Regarding the food, we had a set course dinner, and every course was thoroughly explained. You could tell by how the servers were all talking about the dishes, and the chef, there was a high level of respect and understanding. The slaw salad was one of the dishes that I had heard about and it definitely met expectations. It was beautiful to see all the ingredients and the final product once they were all mixed together. My favourite course, lettuce cheeseburger wrap, was actually the one I forgot to take a picture of because I ate it so fast. Regardless, everything else was really delicious and I would highly recommend it to go for dinner on a date or with friends.\",\n",
              " 'Celebrated my anniversary at Lee. Atmosphere was amazing but the food was even better! The server was very nice and explained the menu in detail as well as her favorite dishes. We ordered the duck confit, signature Singapore salad, and the salmon tartare tacos! The Singapore salad is a must try, it had an incredible depth to it. As a bonus we got to personally meet chef Susur Lee which was the highlight of my night.',\n",

I tried one drink, requested to change it and the second one wasn't significantly better, but I appreciated the server's willingness to fix it. The vibe is nice, but the tables are placed way too close, and it feels uncomfortable when you hear the conversation from the next table clearly, and so do they. The service is good, up to the standards, but not outstanding. Generally would recommend for a group outing rather than a place for a date.\",\n",
              " \"Gusto 101 is one of Toronto's most well known Italian restaurants and for good reason. Attempting to visit this place on a weekend might be next to impossible but with OpenTable I was able to make a reservation on a Monday night. Make sure to book at least a few days prior to get the time you like. The layout of the restaurant is different than most as you walk into the place with an open kitchen and you can see everything going on. It was dim and cozy building the ambiance of a nice date night spot. As for the food, our table tried the arancini, calamari and mafalde ai funghi (aka mushroom truffle pasta). The arancini was delicious and reminded me of the Cheesecake Factory mac & cheese balls. The calamari I'd skip as it was mediocre and was nothing memorable. The star of the night (other than me) was the Mafalade ai Funghi. As a meat lover, I've never thought I'd rate a dish a 10/10 that had no proteins in it but man this dish changed my mind. It's definitely a must try and something you will crave and come back for. The service was pretty good but nothing to rave about, she was attentive and that's all we could've asked for. Only reason this place isn't a 5 star for me is the price. I know downtown Toronto and rent is expensive but I felt like everything was a little overpriced for what it was. Other than that's, Gusto 101 was a delightful experience. 4.5/5\",\n",
              " 'Great Italian restaurant in the heart of Downtown Toronto. The interior decor is industrial and modern and but has a cozy cucina vibe at the same time. We came at a pre-dinner hour, so we were seated quickly and attended to very fast by the staff. Our server was really nice and happily recommended some favorites off the menu. We opted for the Cavolo Nero Salad and the Mafalde Al Funghi. The salad was simple and delicious: tangy and deliciously bitter (from the kale), and when paired with the indulgent pasta, it made for a perfect, balanced pairing. TIP: washrooms are downstairs.',\n",
              " \"It was our last night in Toronto and we wanted to grab a quick pizza to go.  So the wife found this place and I went to go and pick it up via a Uber drive. So when I first walked in, this place was PACKED!  I'm sure you have to make reservations for this place for sure.  The next time we are back in Toronto, we are making another stop here but to dine in. Now to the pizza, we had a margherita and a pepperoni and they were both great!\",\n",
              " \"Pizza is good but not the best I've had. I liked the thin crust, but the flavors felt underwhelming to me. However, I thoroughly enjoyed their lasagna and Truffle pasta. It was very savory, and the portions were decent. I would come back to try more of their main entrees vs. their pizza. The servers were super friendly, and the vibes were nice!\",\n",
              " \"I've been anticipating trying this place for months. We booked our table through OpenTable and were seated right next to the entrance door, which was letting in cold air due to the 3C temperature outside. The disappointment arose when we noticed two empty tables--one of which we got and another indoors. However, the staff mentioned someone else was waiting for the indoor table. While I didn't argue, it seemed perplexing given our earlier arrival. Nonetheless, I appreciate the prompt relocation to the upstairs area, which they opened just in time. Our server, Ilyas, was exceptional and very helpful. In terms of our order: Burrata: 10/10 - Fresh and a must-try. Shishitto Peppers: 5/10 - Lacked a wow factor, just okay. Mafalde Ai Funghi: 10/10 - A must-try; made to perfection. Spaghetti Alla Calabrese: 10/10 Pizza Funghi: 10/10 The true showstopper was the Tiramisu, undeniably one of the best I've had in Toronto. Anyone visiting Gusto 101 should definitely try the Tiramisu. However, a drawback to our experience was the portion sizes. Despite being a party of six ordering seven dishes, the quantity felt more like a snack size. While I understand businesses aim for profit, this seemed disproportionate for the price paid. Management may need to address this to ensure customer satisfaction and repeat visits. Overall, the experience was good.\",\n",
              " \"Gusto 101 is one of the classic Italian restaurants in the city. They have the best mushroom truffle cream pasta and that is one of the main dishes we always get here. It is such an unforgettable dish. Their pasta is cooked Al dente and paired perfectly with their creamy white truffle sauce. I always try a new pizza whenever I'm there too. I got their Salsicce pizza and it is topped with sausages, dandelion greens, chilled, pecorino cheese and garlic oil. I love how much meat was on the pizza, but I was a little too heavy for the thin crust pizza though. The service was not necessarily the best that night and I found the servers a little slow and inattentive. The ambiance was nice though: moody warm vibes, and dim lightings. Overall, I would always return back for the mushroom truffle pasta though, but not necessarily for the service though.\",\n",
              " 'I had been wanting to try Gusto for a while and finally went for my anniversary dinner. I had made a reservation earlier in the week through OpenTable and wanted to make sure our table would still be available since we were running quite late. I was disappointed at the lack of communication by the restaurant staff as I tried calling multiple times but was unable to reach anyone. I messaged on OpenTable and did not get a response either. While being late is completely on me as the diner, it seems quite unprofessional that no one picked up the phone despite their own reservation policies. When we got there, the restaurant was already very busy on a Saturday night. The ambience was loud and lively, and the decor matched the vibes. We were given a table upstairs right at the doorway and quickly realized how terrible the table was. When our server put down our bottle of water, it started sliding off the table because it was just that slanted! We asked to be moved to a better table and was promptly guided to a table downstairs. Although the rest of the evening went perfectly fine, I wonder why the restaurant staff felt that this table seating was appropriate for any diner! In terms of the food, we ordered the Burrata, a salad, the Funghi pizza and cheesecake for dessert. The burrata was delicious and great starter! The flavours and texture of the dish went perfectly together, especially the candied walnuts which gave a nice hint of sweetness. The salad was also solid but nothing much to write home about. The Funghi pizza was loaded with mushrooms; the dough was thin and the crust was soft and chewy! Very much enjoyed it. We rounded off dinner with the cheesecake which tasted a lot like a Japanese cheesecake to me in both flavour and texture. It was light and cakey at the same time; the berry compote gave a nice tartness to complement the sweet. Overall, I enjoyed the food here, portion sizes were good for two people but service could have been better. The restaurant was quite busy and our server seemed to be flustered the whole night.',\n",
              " \"I love Gusto! End up here at least once every time I'm in town. Always hits the spot no matter what time it is or what I'm in the mood for. On this particularly chilly day, we chose to sit indoors instead of our usual rooftop choice. They change their cocktail menu often & each time, I start off disappointed that they don't have what I had previously ordered, then completely loving a new cocktail. Food is great too. This time, I chose the FUNGHI (shiitake, oyster mushroom, mozzarella, taleggio, pecorino, caramelized onion) SO good! Perfectly balanced flavours & burnt crust, just the way I like it. Adored my cocktail too: L'ABETE (dillon's gin, st. germaine, apricot, grapefruit, rhubarb bitters). Absolute perfection. My guy had the GUSTO BRUNCH BURGER (cheddar, herb remoulade, caramelized onion, pickles, egg, tuscan fries) & loved it. Fries were great! He had the STELLA COMETA (wild turkey, amaretto, pineapple, lemon, spiced syrup, chocolate bitters) which was also fantastic. Big Gusto fan!\",\n",
              " \"Stopped by in my recent Toronto visit & could not have been more pleased with this spot! Truth be told, we had originally gone to a Mexican place but after being told there was a 45 minute wait, we decided to keep looking & ran into Gusto. So happy we did! We were immediately sat at their rooftop area & excitedly looked thru the menu. I immediately zeroed in on the DANTE (dewar's white label whisky, st. germain, pineapple syrup, lemon juice, cardamon bitters) & my boyfriend chose the STALLONE (wild turkey bourbon, amaro montenegro, strawberry syrup, ginger beer, lemon juice); both delicious but Stallone won out & we ordered a few rounds of those. My boyfriend, who lives in Toronto & is a regular here suggested the CAVOLO NERO (lacinato kale, zante currants, toasted pinenuts, pecorino, parmigiano, lemon vinaigrette) & the SPAGHETTONI AL LIMONE (lemon, pecorino, chives, butter, chili) & I added the CAVOLETTI DI BRUXELLES (crispy brussels sprouts, black garlic, vincotto, peperoncino). Everything was divine. Very much looking forward to coming back next time I'm in town.\",\n",

Having said the staff are quite friendly and delicious. It was just a little bit on the pricey end. Compared to a lot of other restaurants this is actually good value for money. It just always feels different as an East Asian person, to be eating Asian fusion when it is things you grab eating that might be quite cheap to buy served at a substantial Mark up... but it was well prepared',\n",

The waiters were very helpful and nice and gave us great recommendations from the menu, some we had to order because they were very popular and get sold out very easily, like the Bang Bang Broccoli dish. The Torch and Press was really good especially with the miso truffle glaze on top. The 1000 layer crispy potatoes was pleasantly and surprisingly delicious with the coconut sour cream and vegan caviar on top.

I mean, it says tuna, but it's made of beets. There is also bacon...made of mushroom? We were staving so we gave it a shot. The french fries were pretty good - need a little extra truffle but the sauce was savory. And the no-noodle lasagna had some good taste to it. Not usually our vibe, but for vegan food it was pretty good. All together it was about $40 US so a but expensive for no meat, but Toronto isn't a cheap city lol. Service was good and it's a very modern contemporary ambiance. All in all, a good choice if you want a light meal and you are into vegan options.\",\n",

The prices are very reasonable for brunch for this area. I tried the French toast the first visit and sampled the banana waffles a little. Both are acceptable for what vegan food is. There is a surprise here and there in the taste profile as is the case with vegan food. One can order from the main menu as well. I tried the burger and fries combo both decent.

I have started to appreciate vegetarian items now though so enjoy a good vegetable dish. With high recommendations coming from a vegan friend who tried their food at a vegan festival not to mention a fellow yelper who I feel has a similar palate to moi I had high expectations. First the interior a nice welcoming space with good color scheme and reasonable dinnerware/flatware. However the washrooms are located upstairs and don't have locks!! quite unnerving. We were here for a brunch so decided to order large plates and ordered an app of cauliflower tots to share. The drink list is extensive with some interesting cocktails and a few health focused drinks.  My dinning companions (DC's) and I ordered a bottle of Cava (decent) and one person stuck to Beau's beer. The app was decent (most of deep fried stuff ought to be :) Now for the main I ordered a crab cake and DC's ordered the burger. The mains took their time to arrive meanwhile we enjoyed the pleasant setup. They have the look down pat of a crab cake IMO. The first bite reminded of Japanese dish Okonomiyaki (I luv that dish) and the salad it was served on was good (nice tangy and then sweet notes) Hmm I didn't enjoy this dish as it had a lingering aftertaste. There was something heavy about this dish (the crust or the absorbed oil) that was of putting to the extent that I couldn't finish it. My DC's were OK with their burger. I tried the fries and wasn't impressed with the overwhelming paprika. I guess this place is trying to bring mainstream folks by offering faux versions of popular dishes. However in these two examples the results weren't good. I might revisit as am starting to explore this area and would try a vegan dish which is vegan in the first place. So far 2 stars for food with a half star bump for service/ambiance.\",\n",

Me I was there for a beer and the truffle fries. Very disappointed in the fries. Many inedible because of hardness, and three of us picked at it (large bowl, and only one of us tasted truffle oil. I was eating from all over the bowl but I think the drops were dead center. Maybe two, three drops at best. Come to my house. I make truffle fries too. Truffle oil and pieces.

Such balance.  The Salmon Tataki is like nothing I've ever had; it's like sashimi but with a sublime sauce and fried garlic... wow.   The stone bowls were also delicious, and it occurred to me later that as tempting as it is to scrape it all off the sides of the hot stone bowl when you get it, it's good to leave a layer down there next to the stone to develop a crispy crunchy layer... especially if you get the one with cheese.  Made me feel connected to the eating delight of Japanese over the centuries. PRICE:    A.   Cocktail + dessert + appetizer + 2 stone bowls + tax + tip = $82 Canadian which is only $62 US.   Yes, I'm used to San Francisco prices, but this was more than reasonable. ATMOSPHERE:  A-.   The University of Toronto is right nearby, so there's tons of university students there, even on a Wednesday night.   They do a good job of creating a festive atmosphere (singing happy birthday or giving your group a cheer before you down your sake bombs) yet it's not too noisy when those things aren't happening.  Tables are packed pretty tightly to get the most seating in.  Probably not the safest setup if you're concerned about COVID.  Eat at the bar instead. BONUS!   The bathroom has mouthwash!  It's in an olive oil bottle and you pour it into single use cups, so it's all clean, but what a great idea!  Who doesn't like going back to their dates with clean breath?

The oysters covered in mayo sauce \"kaikimayo\" were decent, very creamy and had a decent flavor. The fried chicken and the oysters covered in mayo sauce were the only 4 star items here in my opinion. The Tokyo fries were not terrible but they were just more salt heavy than other flavors it had. It had a nice presentation and when I saw it I felt like I was in for a treat but then as I ate a few bites I realized how salty it was and that really most of what I was tasting was salt. I say this was a 3 star dish. The salad was pretty good but the center piece should have been the tofu, why did they serve raw soggy tofu I\\'ll never know, it was gross like gelatin, but this salad had so much potential, the dressing was flavorful and I loved it, but the tofu was supposed to be the main part, the meat substitute basically, and all they had to do was sear it so the texture was firm or fry it a bit or something. 3 stars on the salad. The miso soup was extremely salty more than usual for a miso soup. 1 star The octopus balls had so much potential too, the filling inside the balls were yummy and had 5 star potential but then they didn\\'t cook the octopus well so it was so chewy it wasn\\'t edible and I had to spit it out. 2.5 stars The rest of the food was also a bit un-noteworthy.

              " \"We came here on a Wednesday night since we were hoping to visit an izakaya here and overall the food was pretty good, it was just that they were severely understaffed everything took pretty long. While the food tasted decently good and we left satisfied, the food took a long time to come out for all the tables that surrounded our table too. We saw the waiters running around so much we felt bad for them since we could see they were severely understaffed. Has the potential to be more of a weekend night out tapas and drinks spot vibes, but only if they become better staffed and get food out quicker. One thing I wish is that there are pictures of food on the menu since there are so many options since you're sharing this tapas-style meal with people. What we ordered: - Tokyo Fries - Tokyo Calamari - Takoyaki - Okonomiyaki - JFC aka Karaage - Mentai Kimchi Udon - Yellowtail Sashimi - Green Tea Creme Brulee\",\n",
              " \"I love Kinka Izakaya! Hubby and I had been to the Montreal location before so when we were visiting Toronto for the weekend, and I saw they had a location there, I made us a reservation. Our resso was for 8 pm on a Saturday night and it was packed. Looks like a popular spot for bachelorette parties because we saw a few there. We ordered the oyster kakimayo, sashimi platter, carbonara udon, and curry cheese bibimbap. The oyster kakimayo is a fave. We ordered this in Montreal and I liked it there too. It's cheesy and garlicky - what's not to love? The sashimi was good too but pretty standard. My favorite piece was the ebi. The udon was great. It comes with a perfectly poached egg that you mix in with the noodles. Bibimbap was fine - nothing special. It probably could have used more cheese but I don't think it's something you couldn't make at home with those Japanese curry blocks. I wish they had a location in NYC. The prices are also very reasonable for an izakaya so you get a good bang for your buck. Guess I'll just have to visit again the next time I'm in .\",\n",
              " \"An adorable place to share many dishes and drinks with friends! We thought the entrance was by the ramen place next door so just beware that the door is more discrete near the side of the block, not the corner. We tried the carbonara udon (so good and creamy), spicy tuna tartare, beef carpaccio, okonomiyaki, assorted sashimi set, and BBQ eel sizzling stone rice bowl (couldn't really taste the eel but it was a flavorful rice). We also ordered drinks and I got the neko punch. Other drinks included the neko damashi, matsu (matcha milkshake), and yuzu mojito. The cat cups were adorable!

We also added in a $25 sashimi plate that included 2 pieces of chutoro, 2 pieces of amber jack, and one oyster with uni. It was extremely fresh as was all the sushi courses. My favourite pieces were the sea bass marinated in Bonito flakes (super smokey and almost meaty flavour), scallop with lemon and salt (so incredibly fresh and sweet), chutoro handroll (classic), and the anago which is a seawater eel (super soft and savoury). Honestly every piece was delicious. Lobster, ocean trout, tamago... The dessert course is a scoop of black sesame ice cream. The chefs were very knowledgeable about where each fish is from and it is very enjoyable to watch them form each piece fresh. The server was very friendly and attentive. There are 12 bar seats and the interior is clean and simple. Loved every minute. It is an expensive experience but worth it. Can't wait to come back.\",\n",
              " \"Another wonderful experience at Yasu!! Although the price went up from the last time that I went but it's totally worth it. Fish is always so fresh and always get something new. This time the new things that I had is a tuna pate, lobster, mini sweet shrimp... I love how they allow me to have less rice I tired to keep it regular amount but I couldn't so I asked half the amount of rice half way. The dessert or the last piece is ways the same tamago. I love how they infuse the rice and the egg so it's nothing like ones u have outside . It's like cake but really eggy haha\",\n",
              " \"I first came here back in 2009 I think and boy has the price gone up! However, fair as cost have risen substantially and they also expanded Their offering from 11 pieces to 18 :) It's a great place for a sushi treat in Toronto. Sushi just isn't the same after you've indulged in omakase. The service is great at Yasu, the environment is modern, minimalist and a little on the quieter end (I have been to other places where the chefs talk more and explain what you're eating and how to eat it). If not the chefs, then at least the servers will. None the less, it's a great meal and I also recommend it as a great spot for omakase that is easily accessible.\",\n",
              " \"Dining at Yasu is akin to embarking on a culinary odyssey through the very heart of Japan. It's not merely about enjoying sushi; it's about witnessing an ancient art form that's both poetic and palate-pleasing. Nestled in an intimate setting, the decor at Yasu exudes a minimalistic charm that beautifully complements the Omakase experience. What truly makes Yasu a standout is the sheer mastery of the sushi chefs. With every precise slice, artful assembly, and graceful presentation, they transform the freshest, highest quality ingredients into edible masterpieces. Each course in the Omakase lineup unravels like chapters in a story, each more compelling than the last, guiding your senses through a tantalizing array of flavours and textures. The fish, always fresh and sourced from prime locations, shines in its simplicity and purity. The balance between the neta (topping) and shari (rice) is impeccable, reflecting a deep understanding and respect for the craft. The harmonious play of umami-rich flavors, gentle vinegared rice, and subtle nuances of wasabi and pickled ginger in between makes for a dance of tastes that is nothing short of spellbinding. Beyond the sushi, Yasu's service is impeccable. The staff is attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about ensuring every diner's experience is memorable. Their recommendations on sake pairings further elevate the Omakase journey. In the world of sushi, Yasu isn't just a restaurant; it's a temple where the traditions of sushi-making are both honored and innovated. For those seeking an authentic, soul-stirring Omakase experience, Yasu is nothing short of a revelation.\",\n",
              " \"Came here to celebrate our first anniversary. This is an intimate dining experience that is a $185 per person omakase experience. There are three sushi masters (youngest had responsibility of 2, middle had responsibility of 4 preparations and head chef had responsibility of 6). Service was excellent throughout this time and our head chef seemed passionate about his food. Courses came out at a leisurely pace and I never felt rushed. We started off with a small sashimi plate with an oyster and continued through various courses of classics (scallop, salmon, tuna, etc.) and a few new things. I really enjoyed that there were a couple of new dishes I have never tried before (herring eggs on kelp and smoked bonito). We ended with a refreshing yuzu sorbet. As previously mentioned, bill may come as a sticker shock. 18% gratuity is already added on (post-tax) so you do not have to add anything additional on. Overall, a pleasant dining experience. I did see a few individuals with birthdays receive some special extra (though our anniversary wasn't mentioned, which isn't a big deal but interesting). I am glad I tried it but I will say, it is a hefty price to pay so this will not be a frequent place.\",\n",

              " 'I really enjoyed my time as Yasu Of course, this omakaze is one of the higher end pricing, but made by Japanese chefs, you can try to book for lunch or dinner. Everything we had was really fresh, making it easy to taste the different flavours of each fish. Surprisingly my favourite was the cod testicle, super creamy, no fishy flavours, subtle sweetness and very delightful to eat. The monkfish liver was a good one too, again rich and decadent but not rubbery as they poached it. Well seasoned and creamy! Saba was definitely still fishy, but the fresh type with a hint of yuzu. My other favourite was rheir Bonito fish which was oven baked I belive. it was jusy really good experience overall.',\n",
              " \"It is better to arrive early for your Yasu experience than late because they start making and serving the dishes at the same time for everyone seated at the sushi bar.  If you are late, you are making everyone wait, and in my case, i received a passive aggressive attitude from the hostess (who would have thought it would take more than an hour on the ttc from Queen and Bay to Harbord!!!) Before starting, this lovely hostess asked if we have allegies or preferences, to which i said, i don't prefer anything liver or kidney.  Her answer was, we serve only seafood, nothing land. Other than the attitude of this hostess, i really enjoyed everything else from the evening.  I liked the way the sushi chef presented each dish, telling us what they are and where each of the sea (ahem not land) animal is from.  The sashimi plate consisted of a large prawn and a couple of slices of fish.  It was visually beautiful.   And each of the sushi presented all looked and tasted different from each other. I did not walk away from this evening still hungry nor too full.  My friend said she would likely have a snack later on. I am glad i tried this omakase experience from Yasu but would likely not go back again because for the amount i paid, the only wow factor was my reaction to the hostess.\",\n",

What we got: Onion soup Scallop en croûte Wild pacific halibut 16oz p.e.i. rib eye The onion soup and the scallop were good, but the entrees were crazy disappointing. Even though the halibut was cooked very well, the flavors did not go well together. At least it came with mashed potatoes. The rib eye was even worse. The quality of the steak being thin, chewy, & fatty did not meet its price point. It also did not have a char or enough seasoning. The piece we had did not even include the rib cap. Unfortunately, Outback and Longhorn chain steakhouses provide better cuts and cook steak better on a bad day.',\n",
              " \"Came by for lunch the other day and it was a mediocre experience. Canoe is featured in the Michelin guide. Parking is available in paid garages in the area and was readily available. Made a reservation via OpenTable and our table was ready upon arrival. Canoe is located on the 54th floor of the TD Tower and offers breathtaking views of downtown Toronto, including the CN Tower. The clientele appears to be a mix of tourists and perhaps family offices taking out clients to a meal... Started off with the bread and it was like a wet sourdough. I think San Francisco has the best sourdough. Moved on to the wild mushroom soup and it was world class. Flavors were on point and there were a variety of textures and types of mushrooms in the soup. The waiter said that this was a famous dish. Had the foie gras mousse as an appetizer and it was excellent. The center of the bread was lightly toasted and topped with a generous amount of foie gras mousse. The side of pickled vegetables were excellent. The aged sirloin steak was lackluster. Despite the staff suggesting the steak with a higher level of marbling, I found the steak to be quite lean. Requested the steak medium rare and the steak came out medium... The side of frites didn't quite match the calibre of the venue... The onion rings were hand breaded although the breading was much too thick... The cornish game hen was also lackluster. The hen didn't seem too fresh and was rather surprised by the choice of lettuce and onions to complement this dish... Service by the staff was decent although not incredibly polished. Some of the staff were extremely green... ~$85/head after tax and gratuity.\",\n",
              " \"Canoe offers a gorgeous view of the city, luxe ambiance and excellent service, but the food leaves much to be desired. We ordered a couple of cocktails and a bottle of wine to start. The cocktails and glassware were quite pretty, though the taste was just average for the most part. The food all seemingly had one thing in common: the lack of cohesion. It's clear the ingredients were paired to bring various flavours to the dish, but the dish simply tasted like each ingredient separately. This was quite noticeable in each dish with exception to the steak. One dish to point out was the scallop pictured, which was definitely a little underwhelming, as it almost seems like more effort was placed on plating than the food. We also expected more than one scallop to be served at this price point. My recommendation is to come here for the view and the drinks. It's quite romantic if you appreciate the luxe vibe, though being situated near the top of TD tower may make it feel more like a business environment instead.\",\n",

Cocktails are very well done here and the family went for the tasting menu. Most definitely a great choice. The oyster cooked in squid ink was perfectly cooked and was a great way to start. Roasted scallop was also cooked to perfection and had a nice crispy crust. Crab porridge was by far my favorite - briny and livery from the foie but balanced perfectly with tart apple. Trout and steak courses were also very good. Dessert courses were also excellent. The spiced parsnip was reminiscent of apple pie but the pumpkin custard and winter squash was hands down the best bite of the night - spiced cake that balanced out with a delectable pumpkin custard. Petit fours were a nice way to end the meal. Service here is beyond super. Our server Fred was funny, engaging, accommodating and made our night special. Prices are what you expect from one of the finest restaurants in Toronto but well worth it (and a pretty decent value if you're comparing it to NYC tasting menus along with the conversion rate).

Finally, the fried chicken karage style were delectable with a sweet heat and juicy dark meat pieces perfectly battered and fried. We had the quince tart to close and it was a strong choice.

They explained they were having heater issues, but it was nothing a little tape couldn't solve and we were perfectly toasty all night! We ended up sharing a cider flight (a Niagara peach Chardonnay, a KW Thai ginger, and a spruce one I can't remember). All 3 were excellent!! The KW Thai ginger was unique and similar to kombucha so I loved it. For food, we ordered a few things to share. First was a salad with cucumber, tomato, a crab vinaigrette, feta, and roasted chickpeas. That was my favourite. The dressing was incredible. We also ordered the French fries which came with a chipotle aioli and a apple fennel ketchup. The fries were great but that ketchup was the real star!  We also tried the fried chicken which was also good!  Finally, the birria sliders which came with consommé for dipping. They were good but the consommé could have used a bit more.

The service and food were great. They have even more vegan options now on their small menu and they were all lovely.  We had the gnocchi, eggplant and carrot dish. They were all great. They have cider flights and a rotating selection which is lovely. The vibe and ambiance are intimate and lovely.  Will definitely be back.\",\n",

He told us the kitchen will be closed in five minutes because they were transitioning between brunch and dinner. When we were leaving, a much nicer waitress told us that wasn't the case and we could've ordered. So yeah, the service wasn't good at all. I would give it another try but make sure to stay away from the young guy who looked bored and annoyed as if we were bothering him by just being there\\u200d\",\n",

I saw that they have flights of cider so it seems really neat that you get to try a variety of different ciders in one seating. I did eat a lot of the food though. My group shared the fish tacos that were very flavourful with just a little bit of heat. I got the arctic char as my main course. You can see from the photo it was beautifully presented with a lovely yellow bar blanc sauce, green beans, purple sweet potato. It was beautiful and delicious. We also shared their flourless chocolate cake which was delicious. It had a delicious caramel on it and it was a perfect treat to end off the night. Our server was also so lovely. She was knowledgable and sweet and funny.\",\n",

She was so knowledgeable and welcoming, and I appreciated all her advice both about the ciders and the city. :) They have ciders on tap, as well as an impressive list of local and foreign bottles. I also had the best seltzer I've ever tried from their tap! Can't believe they are the only cider bar in Toronto, but even if they weren't they couldn't be beat! I hope to return someday to try their food menu, because everything looked delicious. Such a cute place.\",\n",

The food is delicious and it's really fun to order the flight of ciders. You can try something fruity, or sour, dry, or spicy if you're in the mood to be adventurous. The flight is fun because you get to compare them each side by side. What I love about this place is not only is the cider good, but the food is amazing as well. I ordered the corned beef with eggs and potatoes. The corned beef was super tender and the potatoes were extra crunchy. Yum!\",\n",

Would rec making reservations ahead of time as this place can get very busy. We got two seats by the bar which was great bc we could see what was coming out lol n pick based on that. We tried to order 5 dishes initially but luckily the bartender told us it's a bit much and we cut two dishes into half portions. We tried the following: 1) spicy ceviche - really refreshing but not too spicy- would get again 2) lamb dumplings - unique and not a big lamb guy but in this form it was solid 3) chopped salad- we saw this being made n was very impressed. Great colors not too saucy and very delicious 4) Grilled octopus - would def get again- it was our fav dish - perfectly charred and they served it with poblano sausages which adds great flavoring from the fat 5) Short rib - sigh this dish took the longest but sadly it was too salty. It seemed they used this hoisin sauce plus added salt which made it super difficult to eat if u didn't have white rice or something on the side to balance it. The char was great but some of the fat was bit too chewy - I think they sous vide it then charred the outside but would have just preferred they grilled everything bc that would break down the fat more otherwise it becomes too chewy.. sigh this is the only dish I wouldn't get again. :(\",\n",
              " \"Perfect place with the option to order half plates since I wasn't very hungry when I went there. They don't have much options in their menu but whatever they had was yummy. Tried their truffle gnudi and lamb dumplings. As mentioned earlier, I was able to order half plate which was the right portion for me.  They also offered a complementary savory which was good. A little too late Mocktail with yolk base was yum. Must try! It wasn't easy to get a spot in the restaurant as it is always crowded and they go by reservation.\",\n",

I wasn\\'t thrilled to order a \"chopped salad\" but this isn\\'t you\\'re average chop - its full of fresh flavor and truly unique. The spicy ceviche was also a top choice since it truly different from any ceviche I\\'ve ever had. Certainly no complaints about the truffle gnudi or chickpea fritter either. Service was incredibly welcoming and walked us through each dish. Will definitely make a stop back on my next trip to try more dishes.',\n",
              " 'Delicious food and drinks to unwind on the weekend! We got seated on the north east side of the patio and it was gorgeous - sitting under a large tree with the patio lights made our experience. I tried their award winning cocktail \"Down by the bay\" and it was unlike anything I\\'ve ever tasted but loved it. The \"where\\'s the smoke margarita\" was spicier than I expected and I like spice, so that threw me off a bit. Combined with the milder spiced lamb dumplings, it was a bit too much for my liking so I would avoid pairing those together. The pea pasta was extremely refreshing for a summer night and the beef cheek burger was my favourite. Overall, had an amazing time for a spontaneous Friday night out. The bill for 2 people after tax and tip was close to $150 (no dessert) a bit more than we planned to spend.',\n",

The ceviche was one of the best I've had; the Thai flavours were perfectly balanced and the seafood was incredibly fresh. And the chickpea fritters were the perfect accompaniment, with just the right amount of crunch and a delicious sauce that had my taste buds dancing with joy. The short rib and sunchokes were delicious, but the beef was definitely a bit overcooked. The attention to detail in every dish was simply incredible. Each plate was a work of art that tasted just as good as it looked. I could tell that the chefs had put a lot of thought and care into every element, from the presentation to the flavors and textures. And I have to give a special shoutout to the service team at Rasa. They were attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely seemed to care about making our dining experience the best it could be. Overall, I cannot recommend Rasa highly enough.

You really can't go wrong with any of their dishes, though there are some standouts for sure including the chopped salad, spicy ceviche, korean inspired burger, chickpea fritter, brussel sprouts, and sticky bun. But really everything is great. On our latest trip I went with a big group and Rasa was super accommodating to every dietary restriction (thanks Paige and Ken!) and everyone was super happy with our dinner. The food itself is not pretentious at all which I really love - it's simple, quality ingredients, which have been truly elevated. Everything you eat pops with flavours and they do a beautiful job harmonizing different types of flavours together to create explosiveness in every bite. Can't wait to come back here!\",\n",

We arrived five minutes late for our reservation, our table wasn't quite ready, and the host brought us out complimentary champagne while we waited. The chop salad is incredible. Don't miss out on it. Ceviche is also amazing - a staple on the menu that comes w a creamy peanut sauce that has the perfect amount of acid from the lime juice. The gnudi wasn't my favorite, looking back i would skip and go for something else. The Argentinian shrimp was great. The iberico pork itself had a great taste, but the plate as a whole wasn't as inspired as some of the other dishes. Every cocktail is a 10/10. TRY THEM ALL haha. Sticky bun was warm, delicious, salty, sweet, all the things. Overall, the service is always so amazing. Friendly staff make this place such a great Toronto experience.

Reviews have been great so we thought, why not? The atmosphere is really neat. Lots of wood and it almost feels underground but in a sort of speakeasy way. Nice mood lighting, but you could still bring your mom and she could read the menu. The live music was lovely. Just the right level to enjoy it and still feel like you can chat with your dinner date. Our server was a lovely woman who was really knowledgable. Always there when you needed her and very sweet. The set menu was lovely. A total surprise but great items to pick from. The Gnodi was my favourite for sure. They are huge gnocchi with ricotta then topped with mushrooms and this wonderful gravy-like sauce and a mild pesto type sauce. I'm still thinking about it. I'm not a huge salad person but even their salad was delightful. Very fresh and bright tasting with such nice presentation.

              " \"Scaramouche is an old school classic French restaurant but still provides exceptionally high quality food and first class service that deservedly received its 2022 Michelin star. The restaurant is situated such that you can get an unobstructed view of the Toronto skyline almost anywhere you sit.  We sat in the middle of the bar area which was not ideal, but was still able to get a glimpse of the Toronto skyline in as a refined atmosphere as the main dining rooms. Scaramouche offers a nice selection of local and French wines. The sancerre blanc turned out to be perfect with our meal. We started with the terrine of foie gras which was excellent and one of the best that I've ever had.  The tomato salad was a tasty display of organic tomatoes in a wonderful manchego panna cotta cream.  Their popular special was a hearty portion of pan seared wild sockeye salmon that was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. The cherry and chocolate dessert was a delightful finish to a perfect and awesome dinner. Service was absolutely first class. Our waiter, Ryan, has been with Scaramouche for years and was very knowledgeable and readily available during service. He properly poured the wine and knew exactly how to distribute it among the diners at the table.  Plates and silverware were changed out frequently and without any prompting.  Located in the luxury Benvenuto condominium complex, complimentary valet parking is provided at the front entrance. There are many newer and trendier restaurants in Toronto, but Scaramouche still rates high among all of them especially for that special occasion dinner, but in much more quiet and refined setting.  I loved Scaramouche!\",\n",
              " 'When the GPS took us to the location , we were a little confused of where Scaramouche was due to it leading us in a condo complex. However, once you park on the curb for thee complimentary valet parking, you will see the entrance on the left corner of one of the condos. It\\'s highly recommended to make a reservation as we came on a weekday dinner, and it quickly filled up (I\\'m not sure if they even do walk ins!). There is a complimentary coat check right at the entrance if you\\'d like to leave your jacket behind, and the restaurant will be down the stairs. At first our host placed us in a dark spot for the two of us, but luckily we were able to ask our server to give us another seat by the dining room with the opened windows. It made a huge difference as the wall was blocking the windows, which meant there wasn\\'t any light, and felt off as it was by itself on the wall. The opened window room gives diners a beautiful view of Toronto - so if you can, try to get a seat there. We tried a couple of items on the menu, and the highlight for me were the Sea Scallops. It\\'s very apparent they use fresh ingredients as the scallops were tender, juicy and not as \"chewy\" as frozen scallops. If you enjoy scallops, I highly recommend ordering this dish on your next visit! IG: Ayenomz',\n",

Butter Poached Lobster was a showstopper (not to mention the squid pasta underneath was equally as delicious).

The menu is consistent (if a \"40 years of Scaramouche Cookbook\" were to be published, it wouldn\\'t be very thick), but it\\'s forgivable since my last visit here predated Yelp. The coconut cream pie is still the same, but since everyone orders it, perhaps a seasonal variation? (Peach-coconut in summer, chocolate-coconut in winter... but only alongside the original of course!). We began by splitting the peppercorn pasta entree ($35) as our appetizer- a brilliant move, since it\\'s richness could overwhelm as an entree. Next the expertly executed scallops ($45), and the equally beautiful duck ($45). We both finished (of course) with the pie ($15), but wished we\\'d shared a single serving (it\\'s small, but filling). To impress Michelin, an amuse course or petit-fours would help, but even without, it\\'s still pretty star-worthy (we shall see soon enough).',\n",

So much butter in the food you could hardly taste anything else. We ordered medium rare steak, but it was completely rare. This restaurant is now more like a new branch of \"The Keg\", rather than what it used to be.',\n",

Located in a residential area in a luxury condo community called The Benvenuto (One Benvenuto Place). The Buenenuto Valet can point you in the right direction and you see a clear glass door with an acid sketched logo on the door. It is kind of cool. Upon walking in the door there is a lobby and a set of stairs that leads to reception. Inside is a sophisticated restaurant with a great view of downtown Toronto. For our meal, we started with a Bread and Hummus for Two ($7) with a selection of sourdough and a cracker type bread from the Bread Baking Co. It was served with yummy house made hummus with paprika and tahin. For the appetizer, we went with the Foie Gras Terrine ($31) with a sea salt brioche, pickled grapes, riesling jelly, Triple crunch mustard, toasted hazelnuts and sour cherry reduction. It was beautifully divided in half so two could share and plated. Very rich and accented well with the other flavors on the plate. For dinner, my partner had the special which was the Australian Lamb Chops. He said it was one of the best dishes he has ever had and he enjoyed it with a glass of 2018 Côtes du Rhône Sablet. I went with the Peppercorn Fettuccine ($35) Beef tenderloin, oyster mushrooms, Madeira cream, some pine nuts, and a gruyere bread crumb crust. I loved the dish and the beef and pasta was absolutely wonderful and definitely recommend this dish. For dessert, I had the famous Coconut Cream Pie ($15) and was delightful. I really enjoyed the crust. It was perfect and the pie had a delicious coconut custard, a chantilly cream, white giant chocolate shavings and dark chocolate sauce. This is another must try and was served at a perfect temperature. My partner loves chocolate so he chose the Chocolate and Cherry dessert ($15). It has a dark chocolate mousse, cherry sorbet and marinated fresh black cherries. I had a bite and I could have eaten a pint of that cherry sorbet. This was such a nice evening out with amazing food (absolute complements to the Chef), exceptional dining service, and a breathtaking view.

The lighting is a little bit dim which makes it harder to take good photos of the food but this is a great place for a date or to eat with friends. We got a number of small bites including the short rib, various nigiri, hamachi yellowtail sashimi which we actually ordered twice because it was so good.

The first thing I noticed is how homey and warm the whole restaurant feels the interior is nicely lit and there's a lot of creative art hanging on the walls. The service we got all night was very attentive and helpful. The staff around the restaurant answered all of our questions about the menu which led to a very positive experience. The food itself was really delicious. We started off with the calamari, which is a must. We also got the grilled octopus, fish of the day sea bream, Leonardo spaghetti, and a risotto. All the fish was grilled really nicely, and the pastas packed a lot of flavor. My personal favourite dish was the Leonardo spaghetti. It had a really nice simple lemon sauce that tasted amazing. For dessert we got the tiramisu the cookies and my personal favourite the lemon sorbet, which was served in a frozen lemon peel. I thought the presentation was very interesting and it was a really nice refreshing dessert to end the meal. Overall, we had a really nice time and I would definitely recommend josos for either a date or a night out with a group.\",\n",

I first have to mention that the staff did an incredible job with my very specific request which was to be seated at a certain table. Now onto the food - Josos serves up some of the most fantastic seafood dishes I have ever tasted. The fish, which was only seasoned with salt, pepper, lemon, and olive oil, was so fresh and flavorful that it melted in my mouth with every bite. The calamari was cooked to perfection - crispy on the outside, yet tender and juicy on the inside. Don't even get me started on the seafood pasta! The combination of fresh clams, shrimp, and mussels in a light sauce was simply divine. Beyond the food, the ambiance of was equally impressive. The cozy yet elegant decor sets the perfect atmosphere for a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience. The friendly and attentive staff made me feel right at home, and their recommendations for dishes and wine pairings were spot on. All in all, I can confidently say that Josos offers some of the best seafood available in Toronto. If you're a seafood lover, you simply cannot miss out on this dining experience. Five stars, without a doubt!\",\n",
              " \"Ordered: Calamari & Shrimp Kornati (~CAD$30): a Joso's specialty; lightly floured, canola fried Grilled Octopus (~CAD$36): tentacles grilled whole, drizzled with olive oil and garlic Alla Siciliana (~CAD$36): a recipe unique to Joso's; cuttlefish (sepia) simmered in its black ink Tiramisu (~CAD$14) Glass of Grasevina (~CAD$14): white wine from Croatia Aya's take: What an excellent dining experience! First trip to Toronto and being a huge Drake fan, I already had high expectations. We were seated upstairs right across from the infamous booth were Drake was seated. That table was occupied but we were able to take photos there once that party left; the staff was super chill about it as long as it's not busy and you're not disruptive. Joso's is filled with art on all the walls which was fascinating to take a deep look at while waiting for dinner. The Glass of Grasevina was pleasant, fresh, and dry with a delicious aroma. One of my favorites! In terms of food, you can tell it was all prepared with utmost care and simple yet traditional flavors. The Calamari & Shrimp Kornati was light, crispy, and just the right amount of saltiness. I absolutely loved the Alla Siciliana. Paired with the Grilled Octopus, both were remarkable dishes. The Octopus was also tender yet firm. The Tiramisu was tasty and light with balanced sweetness but not too memorable. All in all, this was one of my favorite dining experiences. Decently priced, amazing service, and outstanding food/drinks!\",\n",

We got a table early right when they opened, I have been dying to try this place. There were a lot of staff on hand when we got there almost too much. The decor has a lot of really different and unique art. Many people are probably familiar with the picture from Drake's Take Care album one of Joso's paintings. The food was pretty good, I won't say best I've ever had but it is very good. I was super impressed by the smoked trout it was perfectly smoked and seasoned. The octopus was prepared and seasoned nicely but was a bit over cooked and became a little chewy. For the price as a main I entree I expected a bit better. It was not terrible chewy but a bit more cooked than I would expect. The pastas were very good. A ton of flavour and the ratio of seafood to pasta was perfect. I'm not sure if the pasta was homemade or not. I regret not trying more of the fish menu items that they display to you fresh before ordering. But I was over all satisfied with the dining. It does have a bit of the pretentious feel to it but so do many places in Toronto. Over all good experience.\",\n",

LOL basics The second time I went there was last night and I didn't even make it to be seated. The manager at the time was nothing but dismissive and rude the entire time after we arrived late to an already seated table. It's understandable to be tired after a long day or to simply say I'm so sorry guys but we tried to stay open as long as we could however the kitchen is now closed. I've owned numerous restaurants from franchises to the hottest supper clubs in the city. I understand.

I think we made reservations I can't remember. When we checked in we got sat down at the bar area close to the head chef. We didn't order anything fancy, we went for their burger and fries and it was delicious!  They torch one side of the cheese when it comes out, something different.  I will say this, the fries could have been cut a little longer, I don't like stubby fries, but other than that very good. The drinks were spot on for sure.

We loved it! The burger - 3.5/5 - it was a bit dry tbh. The pork - 5/5 - it was a really good protein dish with a slight charred flavor and it came together really well. Fries - 2.5/5 - we may have gotten an unfortunate batch of burnt ends but they left a distinct burnt taste that was unpleasant. Pie - 5/5 - it's a massive portion that can easily feed two people and it's very good! Service: The service was lovely and attentive. They give you clean plates between meals and wipe down your table which was a nice touch. Ambiance: It's a very narrow diner style restaurant.

First, it was too loud. Not so loud that we had to shout to make each other heard, but loud enough to be annoying. I did ask that it be turned down, and for a while it appeared that it was, but later it intruded on us again. Worse, though, was the selection.

Wasn't a huge fan of the placement. Being at the bar meant that you got exposure to the kitchen which is incredible; however I despise having people watch you eat while they stand a meter away. Additionally, I completely understand training staff; however I could hear exactly what was being taught to new members. Our server was sweet and made good recommendations. We loved the complimentary bread, stuffed olives, butternut squash, lamb ragu pappardelle. Wasn't a fan of the octopus-- was over cooked and hard to chew.\",\n",

Most of the menu wow'd us: olives and scallops were delicious and interesting, the drinks were a perfect balance of sweet and boozy, and the foie gras sundae was a little bit daring and a lot of flavour. The weakest dish here though was definitely the pork secreto. It was pork without any delicious fats or herbs, and it became a fairly dry piece of meat. Staying with the rest of the menu should give you an incredible meal though. The decor is gorgeous and intimate, perfect for date night. Space is fairly limited though so reserve early.\",\n",

Unfortunately, after all the hype, and having to confirm the res 2-3x, Aloette was the most underwhelming meal during our trip. The menu is small plates to be shared.  We started off w/ foie gras that we are unable to get in CA.  It was silky smooth.  However, like all of the items we ordered, it was overpriced vs the portion. The meal went downhill from here.  The prawn arrived next and it was bland and overpriced AF @ C$24 for one prawn.  Next came the corn ribs.  This was supposed to be a unique item.  However, we found it boring and overpriced.  Lastly, the stuffed wings were lacking any nuoc mam flavor as stated on the menu.  We found these to be flavorless and also overpriced AF. Regarding the ambiance, its small and loud in here.  We had a table in the rear, but it was next to a table of loud, rude drunks. The man at the table kept putting his arm over the booth and hitting my companion.  On the hand, the service from Marco was very good.  He was nice, attentive and informative about the menu. Marco saved Aloette fr being a Two Star 2uesday.  We left unsatisfied visually & gastronomically after dropping C$100+.  We were still hungry later and had horrible food & service in the Distillery District:  It was just a bad night for food for us.',\n",

My friend and I came for dinner and we had to make those reservations nearly a month in advance in order to get those spots. The host seated us almost immediately and the service was pretty good overall. It definitely gives high end but also diner vibes. As for the food, we ordered 4 things including the tuna tartare with uni, lamb ragu pappardelle and the grilled octopus. The octopus was cooked perfectly and I liked the sauce, it was flavorful but I wish I had a carb to balance it out. The pappardelle was cooked very nicely and I loved how the lamb complemented it. The lamb was tender but also a little crispy which gave the dish another level of texture. The tuna tartare and uni was good but it was a tad fishy for my liking. As for drinks, I loved that they were served in a chilled glass. I got the strawberry daiquiri and it was refreshing and perfect with my meal. Aloette is definitely on the pricier side and although I was satisfied from my meal, the portion sizes are almost tapas size.\",\n",

Fancy but not overly hoity toity. I mean the tables are maroon-colored formica and it just WORKS (and makes me want it in my house lol) The 90s hip hop bumping on the speakers was the cherry on top. Now that I'm done waxing poetic about the space -- let's talk the important stuff: the food & drank! The cocktail menu is small but super creative. The bartenders also know wsup; I asked for a paper plane and they made a stellar paper plane. We had the: *Beef Tartare Crostini - fennel, egg yolk, jalapeño- great lil' bites! no complaints! *'Nduja Stuffed Olives - halloumi, sourdough, chimichurri - love the presentation on metal cocktail picks. Really nice savory bite and quite flavorful. *East Coast Oysters - tiger's milk mignonette - probably one of the best if not the best migonette I've had. Migonette is my preferred topping on oysters so I've had quite a few variations now and this one is killer! *Iceberg Wedge - avocado, chive cream, puffed wild rice - WOW, not your grandmother's iceberg wedge. I don't even usually like iceberg wedge, but this had such good flavor, textures..perfection. It was also huge - plenty to share with a dining companion. *Aloette Burger - beaufort cheese, onion, lettuce - the beaufort cheese on this was a thing of beauty. It was sliced thicc and square and pan fried (?) on both sides. *Fries - because a burger must have fries and these were damn good french fries! Handcut. Thicker. Freshly fried. delish. no notes. I wish we saved room for the impressive looking desserts, but we were stuffed!\",\n",

Started with tomato and mozzarrella, varied assortment of perfect heirloom tomatoes but with a unique dressing that elevated it above typical Caprese salad.  The main course was even better, had the fried chicken special, which was an Asian style chicken breast served that you wrapped in lettuce with a side sauce. It was so good I kept debating whether to use the also good sauce because I loved the flavour without it.  I also truly enjoyed the fried squash, which was indescribably good.  The sauce was almost a hollandaise and it included toasted pumpkin seeds that were incredible but did not taste like pumpkin seeds.  A truly great lunch and I'll be returning with friends (tomorrow).\",\n",

While typically common items, these entrees were made exquisitely. The croque madame was delicate and flavorful. The frites came with a great aioli and the meal came with complimentary cheese bread with homemade butter.

The Guajilo Chili was sublime! 5/5 Salmon Tartare- The salmon was incredibly fresh, and the puffed riced scoops were quite a surprise. 5/5 Smoked Bacon Caesar- I love a good caesar, and this was just that; Although, it was a little heavy on the sauce, but still delicious. 5/5 Pitmaster Platter- The ribs, brisket, sausage, and pulled pork were to die for. There was also chicken and turkey breast which i did not eat. Honestly, at this point, we were quite full (all the other courses were very generously sized) and we ended up taking the rest to go. It was still delicious 2 days later. 5/5 Drinks: The smokin\\' Manhattan- This was rather an average smokey manhattan. Nothing outrageous, but well balanced. 4/5 Raised by wolves- Now this was my kind of drink. Absolutely delightful. Highly recommend 5/5 Service: The service was great; although our server was rather corky and not the most hospitable, but still very nice.

This is a Texas BBQ joint, a cuisine I haven\\'t really ever explored. To start, the interior is really classy and modern looking, and a lot bigger than it looks on the outside. Their Summerlicious menu consists of 3 courses. For the appetizer, I chose the caesar salad which came as two big chunks of lettuce that you cut up to make your salad. It sounds weird but I actually enjoyed it! The other options were salmon tartare and a mini birria quesadilla, which my friends both opted for - and they said both were good. For our main, we all chose the same thing: the pit platter, so the kitchen put all of our orders together on a huge platter (as the name suggests). There was enough for everyone to get two ribs, two slices of beef brisket, and more than a spoonful of pulled pork each. They had three \"hot\" sauces that I think are made in-house (?) but none of them were really that hot. As for the meat, the ribs were really tender and fell off the bone. They paired really well with the sweet \\'n spicy sauce offered. The brisket was my favourite; the flavour was so good and it paired well with the espresso hot sauce. And finally, I\\'m not a huge fan of pulled pork, but theirs wasn\\'t too bad. My dessert was the coconut creme pie and the coconut was super overpowering. I wish I had gotten the banoffie pie - it had a great texture and was much more pleasant to eat than the dry coconut. The service was quick and the manager/owner even stopped by at one point to give us a lil\\' history lesson on the building and the story of The Carbon Bar.

As full and lethargic as it might have made me feel post meal, I\\'m still craving the leftovers. The cocktails, the selection of bourbon, and the sides all compliment the platter really well. We took the burden of decisions off our hands and selected \"the experience\", which is a curated meal. A couple of starters, a seafood item, salad, then the platter (which you can get on its own), and dessert for the finish. The pie, which I wish I could remember the name of, was decadent and I could eat a whole bowl of that. Even after eating all that heavy heavy meat.

Please note they don't split bills for a party of six or above and an 18% gratuity is automatically applied. Food is pricey and portions are moderate. The lamb was mediocre and the accompanying risotto was the best part of that dish. The salmon was very basic and under seasoned, sides were also underwhelming. The best dish that evening was the chicken and it was also pretty basic. For dessert we ordered a chocolate cake and tiramisu. The chocolate cake was better than tiramisu. Cocktails were pricey at $22 and I didn't even take more than two sips of my margarita. It wasn't good at all. A bit disappointing for an upscale restaurant in Yorkville.

I also really appreciated how they split it into two separate dishes since we had told them we were sharing it. The steak was yummy although a bit undercooked for our liking. We asked for medium rare and it seemed very rare to us - blu(e) if you will, lol. We ultimately had to ask them to cook it a bit longer, but they did without question and sent it back out to us a little more cooked. The little potato tower that comes with the steak was phenomenal. It reminded me of ratatouille a bit with the layers of potato and cheese. Overall this is a gorgeous spot with great atmosphere for a date night out or special occasion.

The initial reservation process was easy, and we were able to get an early dinner table for New years Eve. There was a prefixe menu available for the night - no gratuity specified. Service was alright, felt a little rush/quick. They kept clearing things from the table right away and setting down courses before we were done with the last. I thought they were just being really attentive but thinking back, they just wanted turnover. The food was alright. The initial course you can choose cheese or deli meats. I find it a bit odd that they don\\'t offer a small mix of both. I literally received 3 pieces of cheese while my bf got a plate of salami and charcuterie meats. The appetizer was great. I had the carpaccio while my bf enjoyed their Bosco pear salad with beets. We ordered non alcoholic drinks as well which were super disappointing. I got pear nectar soda and he got peach. They tasted nothing like the fruits. It was essentially soda water, but I really just didn\\'t want to bother.  At $10 each, I would recommend you take a pass. Just order wine My bf got the beef tenderloin which he thoroughly enjoyed and I ordered the branzino. I enjoyed the flavor but I was disappointed with the skin on the fish. It was super soggy which created a bad mouth feel. Otherwise the dish was good. I wouldn\\'t order it again though. Dessert was alright. I\\'m not a dessert person so my bf enjoyed it all. There was an orange Panna cotta, tiramisu slice, poached pear and cannoli. The cannoli was really soggy. I think they pre filled these a while before serving. Disappointing for a restaurant of this style and caliber. Now here is why I took this from a 4 star to a 2.  When paying our bill, the server didn\\'t give us our space to do the gratuity. He actually watched my bf type the percentage. It was generous but I guess he didn\\'t feel it was generous enough because he TOOK THE MACHINE FROM MY BOYFRIEND AND SAID \"here, I\\'ll do it for you\". He then entered a higher percentage and then told us it\\'s new years Eve. Now, I\\'m not here to start the to tipping culture conversation. But tips are optional and up to the guest to decide. At no point is it up to the server to take the machine and enter what they want. It was incredibly rude and my bf had no idea how to react to that. So the server takes the machine, enters his own gratuity, and has the audacity to tell us it\\'s standard for the night. You bet I talked to the host and FOH manager right after. I\\'ve worked hospitality for years. Gratuity can be set for group reservations or sometimes events, but it was not at all the case this night. The host and managers got the servers name from us and they apologized. The manager was very kind to gift us a certificate and welcomed us to return again another night. I hope they realize they need to keep a closer eye on what the heck their servers are doing upstairs. They seem to be running some sketchy show up there. That server reflects poorly on his team. I wouldn\\'t want that guy serving my guests. If you get a server and they ever dare to tell you how much to tip them, you say no. It\\'s not ok. They are never to take that machine from you to enter their own number. They don\\'t get to do that. It\\'s incredibly rude and unethical. We\\'re unsure if we\\'d want to return. Maybe we\\'ll sit at the bar next time and just munch down on some apps. Their appetizer menu is quite nice.',\n",

I listened to the people who recommended it in the menu... and im so thankful I did.

Honestly, I dont think I could after the appetizer. I got the linguine and i think it\\'s just a bit sweet for my taste buds. Also, my friend had the Ahi Tuna with pineapple, and it was also a bit sweet for her Service: 5/5 The server was super great and extremely helpful to us. :) since we had reservations, we were seated right away.

The charming ambiance and attentive staff set the stage for an exceptional dining experience. We ordered the kale salad (insalata di cavolo nero), mushroom pasta (mafalde ai funghi), eggplant pasta (norma), bolognese, and another pasta. Our favourite pasta was undoubtedly the mushroom pasta - impeccably cooked, rich in flavour, and true to authentic Italian roots. The kale salad was ok, and we could have done without it. The menu boasts an impressive selection of dishes that cater to diverse tastes. Paired with an extensive alcohol menu, it's a haven for food and drink enthusiasts. The warm and inviting atmosphere creates a perfect setting for a memorable meal.

              " \"We checked out Trattoria Nervosa in Yorkville, I was expecting nasty expensive prices but surprisingly it was pretty on par with places like Gusto Here's the verdict: Mafalde Al Funghi - I actually think this has the right amount of creaminess, I think Gusto's can be a bit too creamy. So this hits good in terms of creaminess, however, it could definitely be more tastier. There also wasn't enough mushrooms compared to Gusto. All in all, pretty decent Mushroom pasta & I would def have it again - lowkey a comfort food of mine Rigatoni Bolognese - huge portions, the usual expectation you can have for a bolognese dish, could have more sauce tho! Tiramisu - again, another huge plate! I'm loving the portions here, & you can actually taste the coffee taste They plenty of patio seating, we ended up in the rooftop, unfortunately the views were blocked by curtains as it was chilly that night. Def check it out at night when the lights are on, it's giving romance Food: 8/10 Service: 8/10 Ambiance: 8.5/10\",\n",

Server convinced us the salad options were too small to share. So we ordered 2 salads $16 each which were huge. Poor choice as we had to box the food due to server's lack of customer empathy and only concern with the check amount. No tip for that blunder do it was a lose lose for all !\",\n",
              " \"A few friends have told me that Nervosa is the best Italian in town, and I've been wanting to try it forever but they don't take reservations so you have to time things right. Turns out, Nervosa lives up to the hype. But what I didn't know is that they're owned by the same group as Gusto 101 and Gusto 501, so some of the dishes are the same, and the food is fantastic. We started with the margherita pizza, and it was everything you want in a great pizza - the perfectly charred crust, nice chew on the dough, and the sauce hit just right with the perfect amount of tang and sweetness. After that we got their classic truffle mushroom pasta and rigatoni bolognese which were both delicious. They also had some great bottles of lambrusco (sparkling red wine) which helped craft the perfect summer vibe on their patio. Overall it was an excellent meal, and I can't wait to come back!\",\n",
              " \"Came here for dinner for 1 on a weekday after work. The place was relatively busy but service was still quick to sit and take my order. It had a very fun old Italian vibe and I'll probably be back to try other dishes. Have to keep it at 4 for now since I only had one thing but happy to update after the second meal. I had an aperol spritz which was an aperol spritz so no complaints there. I ordered the Mezzi Rigatoni Bolognese and what I got was nothing short of great. The pasta had a great bouncy texture and the sauce was rich and decadent. I threw on some hot pepper flakes and that elevated the bolognese even more. Will have to try more things but if it's anything like the bolognese, I'm excited to try!\",\n",
              " \"Long story short: Delicious spot for Italian eats in the middle of Yorkville! Long story long: We started with the polipo antipasti (grilled octopus) which was delicious. We ordered the Mediterranea pizza (Fiori di latte, anchovies, capers, oregano, olives, tomato sauce) and capellini (tomato pasta with sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese and basil). Both delicious and fresh! I was full, without feeling that draining carb overload. The service was fantastic and, surprisingly, it wasn't too busy when we went on a Friday night. The decor is lovely and comfortable. The atmosphere, especially on the bright patio along the closed road was nice. I'd like to try their patio on the upper floor as well. Check it out!\",\n",

              " \"Was surprisingly busy for a Thursday night, my friend and I waited for 40 minutes to get a table and since it took us *6* minutes to get there (we were given 5 minutes to return after receiving a text), our table was given to someone else. Once we finally got a table, we got some food (as one does). I got the Mediterranean Pizza, which was fine and not very flavourful. I feel like I could have gotten something similar from Pi Co for less $. We also tried the Risotto Nervosa, which was small in size and quite unremarkable. I'm not a chef by any means, but I've cooked Mushroom Risotto that tasted similar. For dessert we got Tiramisu, which was pretty good. It was just sweet enough and I enjoyed the creamy part on top. We sat upstairs which was a bit crowded, but cozy. It is inevitable to have someone bump into you at least once while sitting. Overall, not a bad place for some Italian fare, but you will have to wait 30+ minutes to get a table and likely drop $40+ for a decent meal.\",\n",

The food was good and I think we pretty much ordered everything on the menu and we were not disappointed. My only comments for future enhancement is that coffee can be a bit stronger. It was good coffee but I need more caffeine. Lastly, easy on the potatoes, too many potatoes, I don't think any of us finished them. Overall, a great place for brunch.\",\n",

Ordered the Traditional (19) which came with eggs, toast, bacon, homefries and salad. It was pretty average. I would prefer going to an actual diner over a place like this. Everything was just ok. They mention in the menu that the homefries are with their \"legendary sauce\", highkey just tastes like ketchup. Instead of a side of pancakes or waffles as with other diners its a pathetic piece of rye bread cut in half. Service was slow overall, took them a while to get us cutlery and water set up. They do have a student discount of 20% so make sure you show student ID if eligible, which makes the price a bit better. Just meh, and busy. Probably not coming back.',\n",

I've had better poached eggs elsewhere, although it's possible it's not their fault and I just don't like hollandaise sauce. The potatoes were semi-crispy and seasoned... distinctly, though not with a flavour I could identify. Such a well-known restaurant deserves a second chance, and the various chicken and waffles options look delicious. But this is my opinion for the moment.\",\n",

One of the big pulls to the restaurant was that it has a lot of gluten free options! I had the eggs Benedict with salmon named charlotte on the menu. It came with a side of mixed salad and potatoes. Overall it was ok - nothing spectacular. The salmon and Benny sauce were both bland. The potatoes were covered in ketchup which was not something that not everyone could enjoy as well. My husband had an omelette which was once again underwhelming. I left feeling surprised that this restaurant actually made it to a recommended brunch spot list actually because it is not somewhere that I could see myself wanting to go again. In other positive news, the service was great and the ambiance was interesting - lots of dark coloured decor and tall pub style seating which gave us space and privacy to spend time together.',\n",

The food came out in a good time and it was piping hot. One thing I can say about the food in Toronto is that it is always hot and fresh lol. Loved the breaded chicken, light batter. Very tasty and complements the waffle perfectly. The waffle was not too dense and not too light, it was just right. Easy to cut into to get the perfect bite of waffle to chicken ratio. Got to try the famous syrup, it was not all that for me. I could have used a little more syrup and or the spicy sauce they added but it was still good with the amount I got. The presentation was nicely put together. They definitely have other dishes on the menu I would be down to try. I would visit if you're looking for a good breakfast/brunch spot.

I tried the Chicken Shio Ramen, which had a rich and creamy broth, as well as a side of sesame seeds you can crush and add to your bowl to amp up the flavour. Their Takoyaki was good, though not the best I've had.\",\n",
              " \"I was recommended this place by a local. You know the place is good when it is small and there is a wait. One downfall to start is that there is no WIFI available. It is not mando to have it, but it is a downfall. I was visiting from California so it makes it difficult to park on the streets without having internet or wifi connection. Not the restaurants problem, but I asked for help or a solution to parking and no one was able to assist. The menu looks straight forward, but there were too many options. 13 bowls, 1 tsukemen dipping ramen, 2 rice bowls and appetizers to choose from. That's alot of options!  This is by far the most expensive ramen I have ever paid for. And I live in the bay area where things are jacked up expensive. Luckily the exchange rate was good when I went and the conversion wasn't so bad. With 4 people, we all got different bowls - Red dragon, spicy red miso, roasted garlic shoyu and the shoyu tsukemen. They all were good in their own ways. One downfall to this place is that the bowls don't come with much. You literally have to add extra toppings that range from $1-$8.5 and you can see bowls will come out even more expensive. The menu has pictures but doesn't actually tell you what's in every bowl. Service was great which is pretty rare for an asian establishment! Our server was very sweet and took his time telling us what was included in each of the individual bowls. And yooooo, they serve you hella noodles. The asian in me did not want to waste food, but boy oh boy.... This ramen won.. We also came close to closing so maybe they were just pushing out what they had left. Regardless, it was appreciated!\",\n",
              " \"When my friend, a local Torontian, highly recommended Ramen Isshin, you can be sure Hubby and I were definitely going to take their advice and we are so glad we did. The food, service, and the atmosphere were top-notch as Isshin Ramen is a great place to get a delicious and authentic ramen experience. We started off with a shared plate of Hiya Yakko, which is cold tofu smothered with their secret freshly made chili oil, with green onions and bamboo shoots delicately layered on top. It was a refreshing and flavorful start to the meal. For our main entrees, I ordered the Isshin Red Miso ramen which set the food mood as it had a wonderful aroma. The thick and wavy noodles were perfect as the ground tofu and wood ear mushrooms were able to intermingle with the noodle's waves nicely. The depth and dimensions were outstanding. My Hubby had the Vegetarian Roasted Garlic Shoyu which my Hubby declared was delicious, with two varieties of mushrooms: shiitake and button. Both our noodles had the perfect bounce and the soups were rich, we quaffed all of it. We concluded our meal with Kakigori Hochi Cha. Our shaved ice was very different from the Korean Bingsu we were accustomed to, as we found this to be more refreshing. The Japanese Kakigori is ice based and made from water. The ice had been grounded down to flakes and then the sweet milky Hochi cha was adorned on top of the ice flakes. Beyond sublime! It was a seasonal special so always ask what their seasonal desserts are and save room for them. My only suggestion is for the servers to take away the trays, as the tables are a bit tight. This is a minor suggestion, but didn't detract from my overall experience. Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Value: 5/5\",\n",
              " \"Delicious and authentic ramen!! I haven't had good tsukemen since visiting LA and Tokyo and was so excited to try it at ramen Isshin, which exceeded my expectations. The broth was hot, flavorful, and strong in seafood flavor. Noodles were perfect thickness and chewiness. It was so satsifying! As for the service, waitress was kind but had limited English, probably much easier if you know Japanese if you have questions. Otherwise if you just state your order it's a breeze. We arrived about 10 minutes after opening and we had to wait about 20 minutes total for a seat and food. Actually I think there was some miscommunication...they told us it was going to take a long time to get seated until I asked if we could sit at the counter where there was plenty of space. I think they usually just seat single diners there? Karaage was also very good. Crispy and big pieces. Couldn't speak for the red miso ramen but my husband seemed to enjoy it. Casual ambiance with an open kitchen. Will def return someday.\",\n",
              " 'I should\\'ve reviewed this Ramen Isshin last year  Am I dreaming? Or maybe it is because their ramen is astonishing and made me dream in the air! If you like Japanese culture or just like ramen, you\\'ll like this restaurant at the first sight of it. It has an exotic japanese-style decoration and the waiters always shout out some Japanese words to show their hospitality. That makes you feel you\\'re really in a ramen restaurant in Japan. Their ramen is very tasty, yet it isn\\'t too strong or savoury to appal non-Japansese people. They also provide vegetarian ramen so you can still enjoy their culinary skill if you\\'re a vegetarian. \"Isshin\" is the Japanese which means to focus on perfecting something. I think Ramen Isshin is qualified for owning that name. There\\'s one instresting thing: I went to the restaurant twice and without any idea, I ordered the same ramen for the both times. I must try something different next time!',\n",

If I was to have a complaint it would be that the chasu was on the thin side.  I haven't had it this thin before.  The extra noodles gave me plenty to eat.  I would of liked it to have more ingredients.  I left quite filled though.  Service was fine.  The place was relatively small and busy.  The restrooms were clean.\",\n",

We ordered a round of cocktails, and I ordered something a bit more adventurous, the pork blood pasta. I'm usually not a fan of pork blood in foods, but I enjoyed my pasta here. You won't even notice there is pork blood in it at all. It just melds together well with that comforting, fresh pasta. The portion size for my dish left me satisfied, not stuffed. Where else would you find pork blood pasta?! You have to try it for yourself. They rotate their menu from time to time, but I see they still have the pork blood pasta on their menu now. I love the romantic vibe as you walk through an alley full of string lights to the entrance. Our server is knowledgeable about each dish--a perfect spot for a special occasion like entertaining clients, friends or for a date night.\",\n",

Most are from Italy, with a few Ukranians who bring lovely energy and passion to this experience. The dinner menu was extensive but quaint. The wine list was perfect and ideal. We ordered several starters, including bread, meats, olives, and Christina (I think that was their name) was an absolute pleasure. A few of us ordered a fantastic bottle of 2007 Sauvignon Blanc, which complemented our dinner choices perfectly. I had been looking forward to trying this wine and wine region for a while, so this was the perfect complement to my birthday evening. We definitely overstayed our welcome and were one of the final tables to leave, but boy - this was a night to remember. I am so glad that our group had a great time, and we definitely made it back home in the cold much safer thanks to the warm and delicious foods.

              " \"Absolutely amazing. So good, I would come back to Toronto just to dine on their lovely patio and eat their incredibly delicious food. I came with coworkers for a nice dinner while we were together (which doesn't happen often). I had looked at the menu on Yelp before we got here and I honestly had no idea what to get. The good thing was that our server was fabulous and gave us the rundown on their favorite dishes and were able to describe each thing on the menu very well. We started with drinks and the one I ordered was so vibrant and refreshing, I loved it. I'm pretty sure everyone at the table enjoyed what they got. Next up was the appetizer and we decided on the Nodini which was warm knots of bread with a drizzle of oil and herbs on top. It was just enough to tease the rest of the meal. As for an entree, I couldn't help but order a relatively new item on their menu... The gnocchi stuffed with buffalo ricotta, infused with basil, pine nuts, and a few other things too fancy for me to remember. When it came to the table everyone gasped. It was down right beautiful and even tastier to eat. I ate every bite on the plate. Don't believe me? Check out the photos I uploaded on Yelp. We wrapped up our meal with a delicate dessert of mouse sandwiched between two waffles with a light sauce on the side. It wasn't what we expected when it arrived at the table but it was yummy nonetheless. If you dine at Buca, you will not be disappointed. You'll likely skip down the alley (which I forgot to mention but is adorned with hanging lights, so romantic) it hides in with a big smile on your face. Thank you Buca for the amazing experience from start to finish.\",\n",

The staff were very friendly, patient and so knowledgeable about all their food options they provide. The best part is that they handle all their meats in house and use every part of an animal in their dishes. Drinks were refreshing and recommended by our server based on our preferences. Definitely let your server know what your palette enjoys and they will be sure to find something that you like. Food. Let's get started with food. The Nodini - warm bread knots with olive oil, rosemary and garlic were great to share amongst the table. Perfectly sized 2 biters to start your meal with. Harder shell on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Spaghetti Al Nero Di Maiale - this is a port blood pasta, 'nduja di buca, wild leek, stracciatella. Don't get intimidated by this dish as it does not taste iron-y at all. A nice change to your regular tomato sauce spaghetti. Get this if you're feeling a little adventurous. Strozzapreti Al Ragu - delicious! Well balanced flavours with tender pieces of ragu. Pasta was perfectly cooked to al dente. A little on the heavier side, a lot of oil at the bottom of my plate once the dish was consumed. But still very delicious! Gnocchi Ripieni - did not personally try this. But the presentation of this dish was beautiful! Perfect for any vegetarians or pescatarians! Finished off with a waffle dessert that was nice, airy and light - hints of lemon. Don't recall the full name of this dessert but it was delicious and the best highlight of the meal!\",\n",

The sauce was brown, not red, and the dish had a very salty taste to it.  The Cab went very well with it.  Our group ordered a number of appetizers that were all very good. This was a bit of an experience.  I almost felt as though I was in a French restaurant - wine and several courses over about three hours.

Heirloom Tomatoes & Tonnato was marked as $16 which I thought was pretty expensive for tomatoes. I was wrong. Okay, it is still pretty pricy but we wanted to lick the plate because the dressing/sauce (?) was that delicious. Jamon Croquetas was also a decent choice. It is a creamy ham croquette with mashed potatoes. This is a tapas bar after all, so don't expect to get full after the dishes. Also ordered several drinks and cocktails including Say Less, Magic City, and See U Never. Every drink was pleasant. See U Never was my personal favorite because I loveee the taste of yuzu and sour flavors in general. Plus, the interior is super cool! It seemed casual yet formal at the same time. We did not really have a designated seat. Instead, about half of the people were probably standing around the big table that's connected to the wall.\",\n",
              " 'We arrived shortly after 6 pm. Once inside, I felt as if I were in another world. It was before sunset time, but the inside was dark/dim with unique indirect lighting fixtures. The space was small - it was like a hideout cave in the city :) A server greeted us and said \"wherever you want\" - there are a few high-top tables, window counter areas, and a bar counter area with a limited number of bar stools. Essentially, it is a standing bar. All the bar stools were already taken by earlier visitors. As time passes, many people entered and grab drinks. Some are in groups, some are solo. In spite of the small size of the space and the number of people inside, I did not feel my private space was invaded by others. Maybe because of the way they arrange the lighting? Comfortable. We had Food: (From  CONSERVAS -Canned seafood): Razor Clams (From PINTXOS - small snack) :Stracciatella & Boquerones (From TAPAS - appetizers) : Octopus & Sobrassada Drink: - Cocktail specially made for my girlfriend\\'s preference (gin based, fruity, and fizzy) - See You No More - Raval Martini - Left Field \\'Greenwood IPA\\' - Burdock APA (on tap) - Estrella Damm (Spanish Lager) We loved Stracciatella & Boquerones. A layer of milky, slightly sweet, super melty fresh cheese, silky marinated white anchovy, and a thin slice of crispy bread. Enjoyed all these different textures and flavors. The refreshing parsley sauce on top perfected the dish. Wow to the Octopus & Sobrassada. Octopus pieces are hot and crisp outside but tender inside. The pieces of Sobrassada (Spanish cured sausage) transferred their flavor - saltiness, sourness, and spiciness onto other ingredients, and harmonized the taste of the dish. The paprika in Sobrassada rounded the flavor and gave it an appetizing red color. Yum! We had Razor clams for the first time (we were a bit nervous :) - it was chewy and soft, which was a pleasant surprise! Among all the drinks - my girlfriend and I both agreed that \"See You No More\" was the best.:) Highly recommend. Of course, the prices are higher than other bars.

              " 'Bar Raval is one of the most popular Spanish tapas bars in Toronto, as evidenced by it being constantly packed at any time of day (especially on weekends), and there is always a lineup. We came in the late afternoon / early evening on Saturday, and the wait for a table was about 20 minutes. They don\\'t take reservations and there isn\\'t a formal system for lining up, so you just have to hang around the place while waiting for a table space to open up. Its unique interior design pays homage to the design by Spanish architect Antoni Gaudi. The interior is very small and has limited seatings. Inside the restaurant, there are small tables for standing and a few stools along the perimeter of the restaurant. They have a small patio in front that is great for the summer months. We sat at the patio and enjoyed the summer weather, very chill vibe, and nice music. One of the things I like most about tapas is the small portions, so you can try a lot of different things. The items in \"Conservas\" section all come in tins and served with chips. For the rest of the tapas, some come with bread and some don\\'t. The bread served in a lot of the tapas is really good - nicely toasted and crispy on the edges; some are infused with garlic. All the food we tried were excellent. My favourites were the Squid in Ink, Razor Clams, Tomato Bread (finely diced fresh tomatoes on top of toasted bread), Mushrooms & Shrimps Tower, Heirloom Tomatoes & Tonnato, Octopus with Beans, and Shrimp a la Planxa (large Argentinian shrimps with lobster & garlic sauce - very tasty).',\n",

When we looked online, there wasn\\'t much of a waitlist, but as we were about to go 45-30mins in advance, we added ourselves to the digital waitlist and found ourselves in a long line. Perhaps everyone added themselves to the waitlist around the same time. We had to wait nearly an additional hour once we got there on a weekend evening. Their digital waitlist isn\\'t that accurate at all! The atmosphere is lively, great vibes and dimly lit. We were \"seated\" in a section with small high round tables with a sprinkle of stools around that section. There are not enough seats for all the tables. We were lucky and took it upon ourselves to grab stools to sit down when another table emptied next to us. Otherwise, expect to stand and enjoy your drinks and bites. The quality of the food and cocktails are next level. It blew us away, well thought out and refined. Not one dish disappointed. The standout has to be the Mushroom Tower. Price point is about $15~ for cocktails and $15-20 per tapa sharable among 2-3. They can also add more single portions so there is never that awkward sharing moment.

Each dish was well-thought-out. You can tell that they are serious about their food, as they have a big open gallery kitchen that is teaming with activity. Here's what we got: Smoked fish appetizer - $16. Most delicious spread. Very smokey. Was served with super thin potato chips. At first I thought it was weird to have a chip instead of a cracker, but it actually worked beautifully. Must try dish. Kampachi - $22 - delicious crudo. Must try. Celery root salad - $18 - very nice. Cauliflower - $18 - very nice. Skate - $35 - very delicious. Was very rich, like a braised beef. Five Spice Cake - $12. Yum! I LOVE five spice, and the cake did the spice mix justice. One complaint I had was that the cocktail list was basically non-existent. The one cocktail I tried (Bitter Spritz 18$) was not great (diluted, sweet and no bitters). The wine options were very expensive. I opted for the Saison beer (Burdock Tuesday $9), and I was not disappointed. Service: 4/5 ========= The service was mostly friendly, but a little lukewarm. The server knew the dishes very well, and was able to remember the options by heart. Very casual style of service overall (complete with hipster scruffy outfits), which is somewhat nice, and at the same time leaves you wanting a little more  warmth and elegance. Ambiance: 5/5 ============ The ambiance overall is very nice. Let's start with the fact that the restaurant is located in hipster-central: Kensington Market. At the same time, it's definitely elevated for the neighbourhood. The place is very casual, but not without elegance. The decor is grungy, but not without style. The lights are nice and dim. It's definitely warm and rather romantic. You could definitely come here on a first date. The playlist was amazing. I kept wanting to Shazam the songs.

Red Tail Bread ~ butter: this 6 dollar dish is my absolutely fav of the night, i honest prob could just order 5 of them and be very happy and satisfied, it is so soft, and the butter is so airy too, if cloud has a form and is edible, that must be how it tastes like 2. Cod: it was 38 dollars, and it is a small piece of cod which is flaky, the sauce tho, it was amazing , i have to say i would be much happier if i can have more fish with more of that sauce with that price. but this just makes me hungry by looking at it. 3. Sweet Potato Cake: it is indeed very good as all the other reviews say, i enjoyed it a lot. some areas where I think can be improved: 1. i think the sign needs to change, in the dark there is absolutely no way to tell the name since its grey on grey without any lights. i know it is aesthetic, but it is not friendly to anyone's eyes 2. the bathroom situation is extremely weird, they have a big area downstairs where there are events /group dinners held, but there are also several bathrooms downstairs, while upstairs there is 1, and where there is any event, eveyrone else upstairs need to wait on the one together and trust me it was not a pleasant line. i had to wait and wait and wait until it was my turn, if your upstairs is already that busy, and there is no way to open another bathroom, why even use the downstairs as a private event place?\",\n",
              " \"Good for a date night, as long as you're not stuck at the bar. Fortunately, we were sitting indoors, but if you're in the patio, the preferred seat is facing the restaurant, as long as you don't mind looking into the park of homelessness across the street. I'm sure you won't be harassed for pocket change as the restaurant has been there long enough for the vagrants to be respectful. I would recommend that your server write down your order if you have more than 3-4 items. We were offered a complimentary dessert for a forgotten dish and a overly savoury dish. Good gesture. If I was with a boring date, I would have had to spend another 30-45 gruelling minutes before I can politely dismiss my date. However, with the right date, this is more time with your sweetheart. Overall, food satisfaction is just a touch above average, but the table seating inside makes up for quite a bite. Somewhat attentive staff, but I do find a little repulsive the reuse of the same damp table rag for wiping down table surfaces for all tables for as long as we were there. One would think a rinse after each use would be warranted. Oh, if you have a bladder problem, be warned, the wait for the single washroom could be annoying. Good excuse to disappear for a while should you expect the check to arrive\",\n",
              " \"SO and I were in town and found this place on a whim via Yelp.\\xa0 The outside was unassuming and a little non-descript, but who cares when there's good food indoors.\\xa0 There were tables along the wall and seating at the kitchen bar...we sat at the nearest corner of the bar with a line of sight to all the staff moving and cooking with intention and care.\\xa0 We asked for suggestions and ordered pretty much what was recommended by the knowledgeable staff. The 7 layer dip came out 1st and we were feeling full just after this...it's comprised of different layers of goodness like guacomole and topped with a good amount of trout roe with chips being in abundance...very decadent! A small dish, delicate slices of fluke, came next...seasoned with some oil, lemon and salt along with some greens on top...a perfect, light appetizer. We also tried the tomato salad, which was hearty and nicely dressed and seasoned. The last dish, cod, was fresh and perfectly cooked...not overly seasoned or sauced, accompanied by broccolini...just delicious! Bottom line, the service was attentive and the food was above average and reasonably priced.\\xa0 There's plenty of value here and we'll definitely return on our next trip back to Toronto.\",\n",

Lots of great appetizers too if you prefer drinks and appetizers to a traditional meal. My friend had the mussels (which come in 4 flavours - she went for the East Coast one).  Comes with a nice mini Sourdough roll.  I had the Schnitzel which was great.  It comes with potato salad and frites (which is a little too much potato for me -- so I switched up the frites for their house salad which was great). Fantastic selection of beers, but also a decent and reasonable wine list. There was no sparkling wine by the glass (we were celebrating her engagement!) - but we just went for the bottle! It has some lively vibe and obviously a popular spot (all tables were taken for the full 2-1/2 hours we were there). There is even a cool spot for singles to sit along an eating bar that faces into the kitchen.  Tres cool. I am thinking next time I will have to try those mussels, although I saw lots of good offerings go by (nice looking burger and pulled pork sandwich as well as a Cheese Fondue - which is not something you typically see!). Check it out -- and hope you enjoy! Service was great too -- helpful, not hovering, and very friendly!',\n",
              " 'Made reservations for lunch for four and was given a choice of dining inside or outside when we got to the restaurant. It was about half filled for weekday lunch service. There are two rows of patio seats outside which was a slight obstacle course to walk through. The umbrella base is this huge square block placed in the aisle so you have to walk over each one. We were seated and left alone with nothing. No menus or water for quite a bit of time. Finally, our server came and served us water. The menu was simple for lunch, several choices in handheld items but not many others besides mussels and one steak. Coworkers ordered tacos and they did not come with any sides so we also ordered the Belgian Frites. The tacos looked kind of small, the order came with four wonton sized pieces. The description on the menu for the Belgian Frites sounded amazing. \"Blanched in beef tallow & duck fat\" accompanied by two house made sauces. Unfortunately, the frites fell flat. The frites itself was not evenly fried, most of the pieces were soft. The sauces were bland and almost flavourless. I ordered the Steak Sandwich and it was okay. The striploin was done right, medium rare as requested. The bistro salad was overdressed, it was drenched in sauce. Overall, would not be back again. The food and service did not justify the price at all.',\n",

One of the highlights was our server trainee Destiny, who was working her first shift ever at Beerbistro and cheerfully admitted that she new very little about the menu, but going off to find the answers to our questions.  She should do well in the future. A nice place to stop in and have a drink, but you might want to eat elsewhere.',\n",

They have a very extensive set of beers on tap to choose from and the bartender is rather helpful in determining which one you might like, even giving you a small cup to sample before ordering. I kinda wish more places would do this since committing to a full pint of a beer you\\'ve never tried is always a little risky. Started with Henry\\'s Irish Ale ($10) and it was pretty nice. It\\'s a brown ale which was new to me. Definitely a lighter ale, not very bitter. Then tried the Stiegl Gold Lager ($9.75) which was probably my preferred out of the 2. Very easy to drink as with most lagers and made for a nice contrast to the comparatively stronger ale. For food, I went with the bistro mac and cheese ($23) which overall was nice, but a bit small. Plenty of chicken, cheese and breadcrumbs to go around, filling but simply because its a pretty \"heavy\" dish. Would\\'ve liked a bit less cheese with a bit more everything else. Decent spot but plenty of options around to try with similar offerings.',\n",

Needed some more flavors and salt. I liked the mac and cheese and we actually got their fries to go. They make these amazing, French fries that are really rich and delicious.

Because I viewed it as a bar, so I was expecting lots of greasy bar-like food.  So, the menu brought a smile to my face as I read through the dishes available.  Seriously, seabass?! Wow.  But I decided on veal as I haven't had it in so long. So, first, I ordered the mussels.  It came in 3 flavours: Belgian white, thai, and Spanish.  I opted for thai as I wanted something really tasty.  It did not disappoint.  Most of all, the portion was generous, which surprised me and made me think that I was in the USA for a moment. The veal chop that I mentioned before was also a huge portion with gnocchi and peppers.  The server didn't ask how I liked it cooked, so I thought perhaps there's no choices when it comes to cooking veal lol.  When it came to me, I thought it looked an bit well done, but as I tasted it, I was surprised at how it was juicy.  My friend said the same for the ribs. For dessert, I tried the blueberry bread pudding with ice-cream.  The ice-cream had a rough texture and it was very mild in taste.  The bread pudding was only ok.  I thought it would taste better with a drizzle of condensed milk. Overall, it was a surprisingly pleasant experience.   Definitely will go back for more bites!\",\n",

We also ordered the Miku roll, salmon sashimi, o-toro and unagi nigiri. All of these tasted so fresh! No fishy after taste at all.

Starting with the Sashimi Select, the pieces were fresh and beautifully presented on a wooden tray alongside three delightful side dishes - maple glazed salmon, marinated seaweed, and pickled ginger. The glazed salmon, in particular, stood out for its rich and flavorful taste. The Miku Select and Salmon Oshi Sushi were just as delectable as I remembered.  The aburi pieces, though slightly on the oily side, gained a tasty char after being torched. The Green Tea Opera was a symphony of flavours.  The green tea cake base layered with dark chocolate ganache and matcha cream, accompanied by green tea wafers, matcha ice cream, and an assortment of strawberries and blueberries - a truly enriching experience. The added chocolate tag for my birthday was a delightful bonus. Our main server was great - knowledgeable and attentive. But the girl who brought us our dishes seemed a bit irritated, as if she'd rather not be on duty. Nevertheless, it didn't overshadow the overall delightful dining experience.\",\n",

This time was during the Summerlicious. Loved their customized menu designed specifically for the event, and as the first #LiciousTO event after Covid, their menu this year was as great as the previous ones. Miku Zen - especially loved the Maguro Tartare, felt that the tuna was mixed with miso but I could be wrong, eating with the stripped truffle chips, pretty tasty. Sushi Selection - yum as usual. Matcha Green Tea Opera - loved the 7-layered combination of mushiness and crunchiness, let alone it's matcha flavoured. Yuzu Meringue Tart - sweet but refreshing. Service was amazing, the waitress was friendly and considerate.\",\n",

Also I like the shape and toppings, which better emphasized the sushi's earthy intensity. Really a great place to have an elegant sushi meal.\",\n",

The good: Aburi style sushi! Any of the torches pressed sushi: oishi! The signature rolls, the creamy udon. I wasn't expecting much from Udon but it was worth a trip or 7. The torched pressed sushi though: worth like 10-12 trips alone for that. Tried their surf and turf roll as well. I thought that was a ok. On a pricier side and a ok. Aburi sushi though, can't go wrong. They are also extremely busy. Make reservation! I got in easy first time around the last trip: I ended up waiting almost an hour for counter: bar seat for 1!

              " 'We ordered miso soup and a Miku roll. For $40 this was not enough food for one person. BUT, this is one of the only restaurants in Toronto, who serves authentic salmon in their salmon rolls. You can notice how deep the colouring and how little fat the salmon has. This means that it\\'s truly salmon and it\\'s not from a fish farm. Salmon from the fish farm should actually be called steelhead trout since it has never been to an ocean. It is also infested with parasites and sea lice and if you read the packaging when it is harvested, you are never supposed to serve it as sushi, but always cook it. You can read all about the salmon industry and Alexandra Morton\\'s excellent book. Just don\\'t think you\\'re eating anything healthy or environmentally sustainable when you\\'re eating \"salmon\" from a salmon farm. Personally, I never want to support this practice, so I always look for wild, organic, etc and ask where if comes from. The roll was very nice with real crab not kani, and you could taste the quality, even though it left us wanting more! The miso soup was perfect with just the right amount of seaweed in it. Again, it was literally three big sips and it was done so perhaps they could fill the tiny paper container full. Regardless, this Japanese restaurant is offering true quality, which is very hard to find on Uber eats -- only Toné Sushi offers salmon of a similar quality, but it\\'s not in all the rolls but offered in one item. We need to support restaurants like this who are doing the right thing.',\n",
              " \"Miku is a safe option when it comes to fancier Japanese food. I came here with two friends visiting Toronto, and they wanted to see if it tasted the same. First, the service and atmosphere were excellent, as our server was attentive. For appetizers, we ordered the ebi fritters, oysters, and beef tartare. The beef tartare was delicious, but the portion was too small for three people. Then for the sushi, we had the aburi shrimp and salmon and the Miku roll. They all met our expectations, but the nigiri was where they lost one star because the rice was falling apart for a couple of the nigiri. The dessert was also good, and I really liked the mochi that our server recommended. I personally wouldn't come back because I think there are so many other options these days, but if you haven't tried them before, Miku is one of the better Japanese restaurants.\",\n",

I didn't enjoy it as much as we were seated right beside where the servers pass regularly to go into the kitchen, the ambiance killed it for me as well as how long it took to get each course when others were getting it right away. Our bill came up to $420 minus tip. Imo, if I'm paying that much, the service and ambiance should be to the T. I appreciate those things in a restaurant almost as equally as the food. I've had better experiences in places that are 1/4th of the price. I'm sure we got unlucky with the seating and given its Valentines Day and all... which was a bummer for us.\",\n",

We ended with the cheese tart which I was skeptical of (not a fan of grapes and it had blue cheese shavings on it), but not only was it absolutely beautiful the taste was beyond wonderful.

The schnitzels were wonderful and not tough at all, super tender. My favorite is the cabbage rolls, the filling is to die for (they actually have the filling as a side \"sauce\" lol).

Our server was friendly but we weren't checked on once it got lively. The menu is two pages but with a plethora of options; starters, salads, soups, sandwiches, Polish classics, Polonez signatures, schnitzels, combo plates and desserts. - Chlodnik ($8.95) - came with a side of potatoes; cold and bland. I had a taste and the cold borscht was fantastic. Our Polish friend said it reminded him of his grandma's cooking. - Flaczki ($7.95) - first time trying this and it was so satisfying. Tripe was incredibly tender and the broth was pure bliss. Came with a pile of rye bread. - Platter for 1 ($24.95) - the boiled pierogis were heavenly with a great bite. The bigos was super flavourful with sauerkraut, sausage, pork and mushrooms. Schnitzel was a generous portion topped with mushrooms. Nicely breaded and pounded thin. The beet and cabbage helped to balance things off. - Cabbage roll ($4.95) - we opted for the pork. Decent but standard fare. - Pulpety ($20.95) - the 6 chicken balls were massive, tender and the sauce really dilly. Plate came with potatoes, carrots, beets and cabbage.

We were here as a party of four following a nice hike with friends around Bloor West Village and High Park. This was late summer in 2019 before COVID spun the world upside down so, for what it's worth, I can at least say that I would definitely come back next time I'm down in the Roncy neighbourhood. I can see that prices have definitely increased, which wouldn't have been a surprise even without COVID and the resulting havoc it wreaked on staffing. My husband and I both ordered a pork schnitzel plate, with potatoes and salad. The schnitzels were very well cooked and not greasy. The potatoes and salad were fresh and well prepared. Another of our party had the roast chicken plate and reported she was very happy with the taste, texture and temperature of her chicken, as we were with the potatoes and salad as well. These dishes did not come with any extras the way some other specials do, so no gravy or sour cream unless you add it on at menu cost. Our other friend went for a vegetarian option and an order of potato pancakes (which in this case did include sour cream, but nothing else.) The restaurant has a wonderful, warm atmosphere with proper wooden tables and chairs, lovely, large front window for light, yet cozy with no glaring light inside. The setup is nice and not bunched up, so going to the bathrooms (which were clean and tidy) didn't require bumping around other diners along the way.

A mouthful of garlicky umami, the splash of Tabasco  was perhaps a bit more heavy-handed this visit so there was a noticeable kick to the salad. The bacon was still served in chunks, a bit too hard for me. I wish they'd change this to strips so it's crunchier... they could even place a strip on top (like the sliver of anchovy) as a garnish. Making the croutons from leftover cheese buns, rather than regular bread, could bring the salad to new heights. Thankfully, no low-carb vegan diet has influenced Jacobs, their cheese buns still make an appearance. One of the highlights of the meal, it's really a Yorkshire pudding with cheese, slather on butter and these are perfection. Remembering how tasty the T-bone steak looked previously, we substituted our typical rib eye order with their Guelph prime Hereford bone-in T-bone ($175), a hefty 25oz (when including the bone) and was more than enough to share amongst two. While not as marbled as my beloved ribeye, it's a great cut for contrast as you receive a piece of tenderloin and striploin. Both are leaner cuts: the striploin full-flavoured and tenderloin swoon-worthy as it's soft and juicy. The steak's crust was flawless and the seasoning perfectly. For those who find it needs more salt, complimentary condiments - a bacon blue cheese spread, shoyu, chimichurri, and selection of salts - are available. Amongst our table of ten, we shared five side dishes, and it was more than enough. Go to Gastro World for the details of the 5 sides.\",\n",
              " 'I\\'m finally ready to write a review about Jacobs. I hope everyone who is reading this review can appreciate my dedication to writing a most fair opinion labored over 3 years and 6+ visits. Jacobs is still one of my favorite steakhouses and (in my opinion) the best steakhouse in Toronto. I can\\'t stop obsessing over the pan seared perfection that is their steak here. No one truly does a sexy crispy steak crust like Jacobs does. The golden brown layer of flavour outside is always flawless and presented on a cast iron dish that preserves the heat. The kitchen will cut the steak for you, which makes it easier to pick through and eat with grace. I\\'ve had a few unfortunate visits where they weren\\'t consistently cooking my steaks to a textbook medium rare, but I\\'ll give it to Jacobs, because they make it up to me, always. The managers here are all very professional and prioritize a happy customer over anything else. I\\'ve had my steaks remade, new sides given and basically the whole meal compensated before. So, I can confidently say, they try to earn back your loyalty and are genuinely apologetic. I just wish they could just get it right in the first place, instead of having me start such an awkward and vibe-killing conversation. The service here is good and sometimes- impressive if you have the right server. With the right server, your glass will never be empty, cutlery will be replaced if accidentally dropped, a fan will be brought to you if you feel warm, your napkin will be folded when you go to the bathroom and a bonus pasta preparation will be given to you as a surprise to accompany your hot seafood platter. On top of all that, Jacobs never forgets to read your notes (on your reservation) or if you mention it when you call. I can\\'t tell you all how many times I\\'ve written down on the notes section of a restaurant that I\\'m celebrating a special occasion just to show up to not even have a mention to that note. But at Jacob\\'s, whether it be your birthday, a graduation or an anniversary, they always mention it or notate it on a complimentary dessert at the end of the meal. For that reason, I recommend coming to Jacobs to celebrate any and all special occasions. I am also always given as a last (parting) gift, breakfast for the next day- which is a baked good, usually muffins. It\\'s a thoughtful touch even though it may not be the most mind-blowing, amazing muffin ever. It\\'s just nice to have \"extra perks\" dining here. At Jacobs, they even have their own dry aging room (which is visible from the dining area) and a full-time Sommelier at your service for wine pairings. There are private rooms downstairs which I assume can be reserved (although I\\'m not sure what/if there are requirements as I\\'ve never dined downstairs and only have done so upstairs). Some notable menu items I\\'ve enjoyed over the years are their dry-aged ribeyes (can\\'t go wrong with any of them), the Westholme wagyu strip (for that special special), the table side Caesar salad (for a show), mushroom risotto (for the value), and their poppers (as a complimentary bread). A little extra note about the poppers, when they\\'re good- they\\'re GOOD. They have a crispy crust and a soft fluffy interior. Their homemade butters and sauces are also such great additions to the meal (you all should try it at least once)! I\\'ve had a lot to say but if you\\'ve made it to the end, I hope I\\'ve brought some value with this review. I highly recommend Jacobs!',\n",
              " \"Let's just get the cost out of the way - this place is expensive.  We knew that, but if you don't, take a look at the menu.  I'm always surprised that so many people have this type of money to spend on dinner, but it was busy so there is no shortage of clientele. My friend and I decided to treat ourselves as moderately as possible here.  The waiter likely sensed this and was very helpful in keeping us within a somewhat high but reasonable budget for this steakhouse.  Service was nothing less than polite and perfect. Surprisingly, a lot of the menu is shareable.  The tableside caesar salad could be split as could most of the sides.  We splurged a bit and got two different steaks.  We left feeling fuller than I was expecting and happy with our experience. I don't have the type of disposable income to make this my new Friday spot.  But if you have the money and want a nice, professional, tasty dinner - this is the place to go.  Thank you for making us feel special for the night.\",\n",
              " \"Definitely one of the better steakhouses that I have experienced. We had a wonderful night! Ambiance can be very romantic and good for group celebration. Every dish we had was seasoned and cooked perfectly. We were a party of 4 and we ate everything pictured! The mushroom risotto was one the best that I have ever had. Service was excellent; although they did charge us for a drink that we didn't order. The Burly Peach was a disappointment but the Jade Spring was surprisingly good and refreshing! So, get out of your comfort zone and try something new. Valet ($25) as well as street and parking garages are available.\",\n",
              " 'Service is very good. The food is very good, would recommend if you like steak. Got the A4 wagyu but it was just too fatty for my liking. Definitely check out their sides, especially the duck fries was my favourite. Oysters were fresh very fresh, instead of dessert we just got more oysters at the end.',\n",
              " \"Pros: - Great customer service - Good variety of food and drinks that all taste good - An experience Cons: - Not the best steak I've had - Expensive Had the high river steak which was beautiful. Was good but not blown away. Would definitely visit again to try more of their steaks. The salad they made in front of you which was cool to see. Got complementary dessert at the end. The place normally gets packed after 7pm. My highlights were the Kumamoto oysters and the duckhorn red wine, they were exceptional.\",\n",
              " \"Easily the best steakhouse I've ever been to, and the steak isn't even the best part for me. Excellence perspires through every plate that comes out of that kitchen, and the attention to detail is immaculate. They start you off with their warm bread and butter. The bread is fluffy and crusty all at once, with a lovely herby butter that is dangerously good. Some of the best bread and butter I've ever had, and you're off to a good start. The apps are great across the board, but there's nothing better than the caesar salad. It is bar none, the best salad I have ever had in my life, perfectly dressed and with a mouth-watering combination of textures and flavours in every bite. The seafood is also very good, I especially enjoy their oysters and jumbo shrimp, which are absolutely massive. At this point it's hard not to be full, but the meat is the main event. I recommend getting one of the bigger lower grade steaks to fill up on, with an Aussie wagyu and a Japanese wagyu to taste. The Japanese wagyu is like eating butter, it just melts on your tongue. The Aussie wagyu is my favourite - slightly less fatty but with immense character in the flavours. As for the rest of the steaks, they're all solid, but one bite of the wagyu and it's hard to go back to the regular stuff. When it comes to dessert, everything is solid but not mind blowing. They send you home with a chocolate chip muffin which I usually like to save for breakfast, and it's easily the best muffin I've had in my life. Overall, this place is definitely worth it - it is easily one of the best steakhouses / meals I've had in my life, and consistently blows me away every time I try it.\",\n",
              " \"My post-pandemic birthday celebration was top notch. When you approach the building, it's a bit hidden. Behind these taller than lifesize double doors, you descend down a flight of steps. Your eyes squint in the dimly lit entrance as you're asked about your reservations, valet, and coat check by a line of ladies. Once checked in, you're led through the 3 compartment labyrinth starting with the piano lounge (chill and for groups), up a stairs to another busy (family/groups) section including a bar (single seats), and then finally to the romantic (2 person or 4 persons table) section. Along the way to the romantic zone, you walk by this giant fridge full of these impressive cuts of meat. All I remember was that they were meaty and juicy, and humungous. Server then comes with menus and introduces the steak menu, and the fact that you can order half portions of the sides. We had a look at the menu beforehand so had a rough idea of narrowing down our choice of steak. The steak menu is vast with steaks ranging from $100 to just under a cool $1,000. But if you think that was impressive enough, you haven't looked at the wine menu. Hundreds and hundreds of different wines. We ordered a shareable steak, the Caesar salad (which is a fun little show where they make it infront of you), a few JUMBO shrimps (seriously, the biggest shrimps I've ever seen), and the mash potato and mushroom sides. The steak was succulent and perfectly cooked. The sides were a bit underwhelming and the cocktail I ordered wasn't that spectacular. Moving to desserts, we had the flourless chocolate cake with mint ice cream and loved it. Thought the mint ice cream was similar to Bang Bang on Ossington. Service was attentive, but we noticed that we didn't get the full explanation of how the meal was cooked like how the other tables did. They fold your napkins for you when you're in the washroom which is nice. They did light a candle on my dessert and wished me a happy birthday but no comp on the dessert, which is fine. Price: expect to pay $150+ per person but the sky is the limit. Overall, definitely an experience and wish we asked to be seated near the piano -next time! One thing that stood out was that all staff wished us good evening on our way in and on our way out. That means a lot!\",\n",
              " \"Overall good experience but could be better for such a high end restaurant with prices that reflect $$$$ We were there to celebrate a friend's milestone birthday. Our servers were friendly, but some things that stood out was that my shoulders kept getting nudged when they were putting down food, cutlery, or anything that required reaching in, we were a group of 10 but were seated quite sparsely. Another thing was when our server was trying to take an extra place setting away, instead of taking one item at a time, he asked for us to hand him everything on the placemat, which had fork, knives, glass, plates etc. and as I expected everything fell on me... lol...luckily no sharp steak knife. The Cesar salad is still one of my faves. The foie gras looked completely burnt on the outside and mushy on the inside, really turned me off. The bone marrow for some reason tasted like uncooked piece of fat even tho it was cooked... really weird never experienced this before. The steaks were not great cuts for over $400/piece. One steak was half fat, and the other was too rare. The bass ceviche was light, I enjoyed this dish. We brought our own cake, the fee was $5/person. They didn't allow splitting bills or splitting payments.\",\n",
              " \"We went here for a nice dinner date as we heard good things from our friends, and we were not disappointed. From start to finish, the service was impeccable and the ambiance was very nice. We hadn't been to very many steakhouses so our server was very helpful explaining the menu and the different cuts of meat. I would 100% recommend the table side made Caesar salad. It might've been the highlight of the meal if the steaks weren't so good. Something about seeing all the individual ingredients come together in front of you and then eating the final product was amazing. In terms of the stakes, I feel like you can't go wrong with any of the cuts. Both steaks we got were perfectly seasoned and cooked medium rare. We didn't get any Wagyu, but next time we will for sure. It was my first time eating steak with some of the sauces that were provided, and my favourite was the blue cheese. We had a really good experience at Jacobs and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a nice steakhouse in Toronto.\",\n",

We ordered the whole menu basically, starting with chips and salsa (solid) and ceviche which was perfectly balanced acidity wise and made for a great bite. Of course they also had great margaritas which leaned on the sour side but had a great kick. Next were tacos, and in order of excellence they were: - beef: explosive flavours, crunchy taco shell for texture, chunky guac - fish: perfectly crispy and lightly fried, lot of slaw but went nicely with the lime - chicken: meat was pretty good with the crunch shell and guac once again - pastor: meat was just ok but pineapple was great touch Finally, the reason this place gets that 5th star is the churros. This was probably the best churro I've ever had, with unreal textures of light crispness on the outside and soft doughy inside. It came with a cajete sauce with marshmallows, and that sauce took the churros to the next level. I can't wait to come back if only just for these churros.\",\n",

They should put a disclaimer when booking a reso, the patio was the only reason we wanted to go in the first place. It was like an hour wait to get a seat outside since it was \"first come first serve\" I have been here two times and both times I went I got attitude from the service.

Zakkushi has an upbeat vibe as shown by their super energetic staff! Their food quality is excellent and overall I\\'d say it\\'s a solid 4.5 stars.  Below are a few items I particularly like: - Tsukune: they mix the minced meat with bits of soft bones, which enhance the texture of the chicken meatball. - Nankotsu: the chicken knee cartilage is so crunchy and chewy. Must try! - Liver / Gizzard / Heart: just forget about cholesterol level for the night and go all-in. You won\\'t regret it! - Beef tongue: with or without onion on top, both are good. - Yakionigiri: finish the meal with a grilled rice ball is just SO satisfying :) There was a minor issue during my most recent visit, which led me to give them a 4-stars rating (for now).  Our first round of skewers aren\\'t hot enough and don\\'t have the hints of charcoal smell. From second round and on, it\\'s back to their usual high quality. We arrived super early that day, so I wonder if the situation was caused by the charcoal grill still \"warming up\" at the time. I\\'ll definitely go back again, again, and again!',\n",

Drinking warm saké and eating skewers with friends in a Japanese-style decorated izakaya is a lovely experience on a cold winter night. Be aware that izakaya is just like a bar, it will cost you too much if you want to have \"dinner\" here. It\\'s a good place to hang out with friends and have couple of drink',\n",

Very authentic service and atmosphere where servers welcome you and other customers by shouting really loud in Japanese. The menu changes all the time and is a great place to try authentic Japanese cuisine. Their recent special includes the uni udon and the tofu skewers. Highly recommend the uni udon. If you've never had uni it's very creamy and provides a delicious seafood flavour to the udon. Definite must try. Also highly recommend the Zakkushi skewer set and the chicken karaage. The skewers all have a smoky flavour from the wood fire grill they are grilled on. Each skewer is also so different that it provides a refreshing change of pace and interesting insight into Japanese flavours. The chicken karaage is also fried to perfection with a very crispy skin. It is perfectly paired with a creamy mayo sauce that adds another dimension of texture and flavour. Also would recommend trying out the unique Japanese cocktails and beers that go great with the small bites. The okinomiyaki is very nice if you've never had it before but is much smaller than you think. This place is a great place for drinking and having a small meal. If you're trying to get full it might get a bit pricey as you will have to order more plates. Although the portions may be smaller, it's a great place to try a variety of authentic and delicious Japanese food, plus it also feels like you are in Japan. Definitely give this place a try!!\",\n",

              " \"With all the hype that Alo gets, my expectations were pretty high coming in for a New Year's Eve tasting menu. We were seated in the bar room, which wasn't very spacious, but had a nice moody aura. Though Alo is labelled as a French restaurant, our seven course meal was surprisingly Japanese, with components like bluefin tuna sashimi, sake kasu, and maitake mushrooms. My favourite courses were the koshihikari rice white truffle risotto and the east coast scallop topped with caviar. Flavours of each dish were well balanced in every course, tasting best with all elements in one bite. Service was great throughout the evening. My friend didn't like the foie gras (our second course), and the waiter promptly replaced it with a citrus-y beet salad. We appreciated that they were well prepared for such a scenario, especially with how rich the foie gras is. Fresh cutlery was provided with every course, with the waitstaff clearing the table in sync. I was content with my experience, and I do think Alo deserves their star, but with a price point of $250pp, I wasn't entirely blown away. You are also required to pay the full amount upon booking. I'd love to come back in the future to see if the dining room experience is different.\",\n",
              " 'As I recount my latest experience at Alo, I grapple with the final mark: would I still consider them a 9 or a \"top pick\"? There were dishes that were incredible, but then some that missed the mark. The tasting menu ($225 per person) was off to a shaky start when the canapés arrived. We\\'re instructed to eat the four bites in a particular order. The first, an oyster with compressed cantaloupe and Iberico ham oil had a fishy essence without an acidic element (like the traditional mignonette or lemon) to help cut through the strong taste. It also seemed off that it wasn\\'t ice cold for something that should be served uber fresh. The first bite was a bust. Slowly, the redemption started with the beautifully presented uni tart, which was made even creamier with a thick crème fraiche on the bottom. While this wasn\\'t mind-blowing, it was at least not repulsive. After the fishy oyster I had doubts about the mackerel tart, but this was unfounded as the meaty fish was very clean tasting and well balanced with bright pops of the daintiest tomatoes and fruit. Indeed, there was an ocean-like essence from the caviar, but it wasn\\'t overpowering. The canapés ended with a foie gras and strawberry jelly tart that created a sweet and savoury element. This was surprisingly good and wonderfully rich. It\\'s unclear if Alo is pandering to Michelin inspectors as the procession of Japanese dishes just seem out of place at a French restaurant. Sure, I can understand if they want to throw in one dish that\\'s has a Japanese influence, but to feature a handful was just too much. Moreover, some dishes just can\\'t live up to what you\\'d be served during an omakase meal. Chef Patrick Kriss should drop the madai course, a sea bream paired with chili oil, caviar, and kumquat. Like the oyster, it was fishy and warm. Give me this fish cool with freshly grated wasabi and soy sauce any day. The kinmedai was better, the red snapper was at least cold and refreshing with the oh so finely julienned radish in the centre. The various oils complimented the fish nicely and this was an improvement over the other sashimi course. If Alo must have a sashimi course (why would it), one is enough. Having a soft spot for chawanmushi I wouldn\\'t be opposed to this remaining on the menu. The actual steamed egg was hot and silky, but then enhanced with lovely French and Western elements: smooth foie gras tofu cubes, fragrant truffle paste, crunchy radish, sweet corn, and crispy chicken skin. All this amongst a pool of reduced capon broth. What an incredible dish! This is a long review, head to Gastro World for the rest.',\n",

We both loved our experience. They saved a special corner table (# 26) for us, overlooking the rest of the bar area. Food was a 5-course menu for $120 ea.

              " \"9.5/10 Alo has Been on my list for a very long time. I'm So glad that the fiancée was able to book us a table! Excellent food The whole menu and Each dish was well balanced well thought out. The menu did introduce me to different flavours and combination that will get me thinking about again and again! Service Impeccable service - the best service I had. It was the little things that makes this an amazing experience Our reservation was at 915 pm and we were seated promptly. We didn't finish until 12am so it was quite a long dining experience. Couple of dishes that didn't really wow me for example we had a pasta dish, and desserts was ok (although it introduced me to canelés and I'm obsessed). Expect your wallet to hurt. We ordered 2 glasses of wine and added truffles to one of our meals. That was almost an additional of $150. This is definitely a restaurant worth visiting and experiencing. Great for occasions. Highly recommend this to anyone who can obtain a reservation!\",\n",
              " \"Food: 9/10 Service 10/10 I really loved my experience here! The canapes, Hokkaido Scallop, Shima Aji, Wagu & Oyster, East Coast Lobster, Japanese A5 wagyu, Lemongrass & Limquat were all exquisite! Alo definetely has the most unique and unbeatable flavor. However, the pasta dish was not up to my expectations and failed to impress me. But let me tell you about the Japanese A5 Wagyu - it was simply divine! The meat melted in my mouth, and I finally understood what Gordon Ramsay meant by saying how steaks would melt in his mouth. It was so much better than any other steak I've had. Although it did get too fatty in some bites, to the point where I chugged my entire mocktail, I didn't notice the wasabi at first, but once I did, it changed the taste in the most delightful way. As for the Lemongrass & Limequat, it was refreshing and light, and I simply adored it. The Mont Blanc Petit fours were a little too sweet for my taste, but the coffee balanced it out. I especially loved the box that came with the dessert; I wanted to take it home with me! I must commend the waitstaff; they were all lovely and made my dining experience even more delightful. All in all, I truly enjoyed my time here and can't wait to come back!\",\n",
              " \"This place has been on my list for years, it was definitely worth the wait. My boyfriend and I went with the full tasting menu and got a cocktail each with our meals. Here are my thoughts on the courses: 0. Canapés - love the presentation and taste of every bit. It was a great balance of unique flavours, mostly savoury and creamy. My favourite bite was the smoked salmon with caviar. The tart crust was so crispy, the salmon was very fresh and the caviar was a great pop of flavour. 1. Hokkaido Scallop - these were the best scallops I've had! Super fresh with a hint of sweetness. The zesty sauce was a great compliment. 2. Wagyu & Oyster - one of my favourite bites of the night. The wagyu was so buttery. I usually don't enjoy raw oyster, but this was very fresh. The 2 purées were refreshing and light. Excellent balance to the buttery wagyu. 3. Shima-aji - these sashimi slices were so fresh. The spot of yuzu really brought out the natural flavour of the fish. 4. East Coast Lobster - thoroughly enjoyed this dish as well. The lobster was springy and sweet. The uni was very creamy with a light salty flavour. The egg based sauce added to the creaminess of the dish. This was a very filling and comforting dish. 5. Koshihikari Rice - this dish resembled a risotto. Loved the mushrooms used. The rice itself was slightly on the saltier side. 6. Swordfish - very unique chewy texture. Loved the flavour of the spicy peppers and sauce. 7. Pecking duck - very tender and flavourful. The purée was an amazing complement to the meaty flavour of the duck. Be sure to eat them together! 8. Provimi Veal Tenderloin - this tasted so much better than it looked. It was one of the most tender steaks I've had. The light salt brings out the natural flavour of the meat. Don't skip out on the eggplant purée! It was an excellent complement to the veal if you wanted a stronger smoky flavour. I should also shoutout the butter milk bread, so soft and buttery! 9. Dessert 1 - love the chestnut praline topping. Inside the chocolate dome contained ice cream and meringue. A delightful dessert with many textures and flavours. 10. Petit Fours - contained yuzu Madeline, chocolate tart. Chocolate rum Choux, and Canelé. This was my first time having Canelé and I absolutely loved it! Overall one of the best dining experiences I've had! The waiter and all the staff were super attentive and friendly. Definitely worth the price :)\",\n",
              " \"I've been wanting to go here for a while and was worried that reservations would be hard to get after they received their Michelin star. Luckily I was able to get one, but they do get filled up quick! I made the reservation over Tock about 2 months in advance. Right when we walked in we were greeted at the elevator and they asked if we wanted our coats taken. We were taken to our seats and asked if we wanted any champagne before the meal. We were also asked if we were interested in any upgrades/additions to our meal including a wine pairing. Our meal was 11 courses with the option to add an additional course. There were 2 wine pairings to choose from, a regular and premium one. We opted to have one regular pairing and share as we're not much of wine drinkers. During the meal they started off every course with a brief explanation of the dish. If there was a wine pairing for the course the wine would come first with an explanation as well. In between courses our utensils were changed as well. All the courses were really good. We especially loved the lobster and swordfish courses. For dessert we were given an additional small cake as we were celebrating a birthday. After our meal was finished we were given our menu for the night as well as our wine pairings. The service and food was excellent throughout the whole night.\",\n",
              " \"I had wanted to go for a while and kept missing the drop dates for reservations, so I was excited when I was finally able to get one. I can see why this place was awarded a Michelin star. Everything about our meal from start to finish was amazing. The service staff were all very caring and attentive to our needs. The lighting and ambiance of the restaurant was really nice and felt very cozy. We got our own little booth and after ordering drinks, we started the tasting menu. Every course was well explained, and although they were small bites, which was to be expected, it was delicious. My favourite course of the night was a lobster dish with a creamy egg sauce. They were many courses, so I'm not going to go into each one, but there was a heavy influence of French and Japanese cuisine. Overall, I would say the experience and the food is worth the price. Its not something I would do on the regular, but it was very nice going and seeing what the hype was about. I would say it is one of the best dining experiences I've had in Toronto.\",\n",

I sat at the bar and had a Keg Classic which is a salad, choice of meats and side.  I opted for the Caesars salad followed by prime rib which was cooked to order, medium rare.  Service was very good. All that said, I can't quite give it five stars.  My vodka soda was on the weak side and glass of Pinot Noir tasted like it came from a bottle that had been open for a while.  The Caesar Salad has just a little too much dressing and I thought the cut of prime rib was not quite top shelf.  I would definitely give it another go, maybe try the house salad and sirloin next time.\",\n",

Dinner reservation for 6 pm on a Friday was made earlier that day and we were surprised how empty the place was when we left at 7:30 but I surmise it is due to the crazy downtown traffic in the Core area.',\n",

I've never taken the time to write a restaurant review, but felt last night was deserving of one. I can't say we've ever enjoyed our waiter/server at any restaurant as much as we enjoyed David last evening. He was exceedingly attentive and engaging, even with our kids, which we really appreciated. He was quite funny as well, and rather goofy, in a good way! Instead of just going through the motions as many waiters do, he genuinely seemed to enjoy his job, and take care to ensure we enjoyed our dinner/experience at the haunted mansion.

              " \"The Keg is a Canadian steakhouse chain that also has several locations in the U.S.  I am not a big fan of chains in general, let alone give it a 5-star rating, but this particular location impressed me. Located in a mansion built in 1867, it was home to 's illustrious Massey family in 1882 that included the famous Hollywood actor, Raymond Massey. The Keg eventually acquired the property in 1976 and refurbished it to its original elegance to be their prestigious flagship restaurant. The Keg Mansion, as it is known, serves top quality steaks, prime rib and seafood in a refined and relaxed atmosphere. There are several dining rooms on both the main floor and on the second floor with its own unique ambiance.  We were fortunate to dine at the Keg Mansion during their special Lobster Summer menu. I ordered their 10 oz prime rib with half live Atlantic lobster. No doubt, the Keg knows how to cook and serve high quality meats.  The prime rib was tender, perfectly seasoned and flavorful. The half live lobster was split perfectly in half, grilled, and served with melted butter.  It was an excellent surf and turf dinner.  But leave room to share their Billy Miner Pie for dessert.  It was a delightful mocha ice cream pie that gives your dinner that perfect finish. Service was very good.  We sat on the second floor that had its own bar, but our waiter, Ray, gets his exercise by going up and down the stairs to the kitchen for our food. He was attentive and made sure our needs were taken care of by the support staff.  Parking is in front and adjacent to the restaurant. After 6pm, there is no charge in the adjacent public lot. The Keg Mansion is an excellent and popular Toronto steakhouse.  Its food quality and service are very much comparable to any of those overpriced steakhouses you will find elsewhere.\",\n",
              " 'Need to hearty serving of steak and chocolate cake?  Come to the Keg.  If you need the extra steps to justify your meal, ask for a table upstairs. The Ribeye is on point. The wedge salad can help assuage any guilt, but really, you want the steak.  Save room for the chocolate cake al a mode. Why? Because it is good,  you want it, and after a whole steak why the heck not? If you really feel guilt about the calories, take a Lyft to the restaurant and then walk home.  Otherwise, just live it up!',\n",
              " \"I can't resist raving about The Keg! Every visit leaves me absolutely delighted. This place has yet to serve me a dish I wasn't head over heels for. On my recent visit, I had their divine steak dinner. Cooked to perfection, it was a carnivore's dream come true. But what truly sealed the deal was the exceptional service. Our waitress went above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was top-notch. She even managed to secure the booth I had requested when I made the reservation - talk about attention to detail! It's establishments like The Keg that make me a loyal fan. You can bet your bottom dollar that a meal here comes with a guarantee of excellence. Great food, impeccable service, and a fantastic ambiance - The Keg knows how to leave a lasting impression.\",\n",
              " \"Great atmosphere in an old mansion. I've been to several keg locations, and they are all consistently good. This time we started with the cauliflower appetizer which they seem to have recently updated and it was even better. Crispy, just slightly spicy outside and soft inside. I also had a wedge salad because I love blue cheese and this did not disapoint. I had a filet for the entree with garlic mashed potatoes and it was all great, just like everything before.\",\n",

              " 'As a non-meat eater, I love The Keg because its seafood and vegetarian dishes are quite good for a steakhouse chain. ** AMBIENCE ** The Keg Mansion has a different ambience compared to the other locations - it\\'s more comfortable, homey, and spacious. Located in a converted mansion, it occupies 2 floors with multiple \\'rooms\\', leather couches, wide comfortable seats, wooden accent interior, and stained glass windows. We came around Christmas time, and the interiors were all decorated with very festive hoiday decorations and small Christmas trees. The first floor has a half open-concept kitchen that you can walk in and peek at what the chefs are doing. It also has spacious dining rooms with ample seatings (that tend to get filled up quickly as soon as it opens, so make a reservation where possibel!). We were seated upstairs by the window (with a lovely mini Christmas tree decoration right beside us), making a nice photo op. There was a bar with screens showing sports games in the middle of the floor, and rooms and dining tables around it. The bar has a different menu (e.g. you can order sliders at the bar). Washrooms are located on the 2nd floor. ** FOOD ** Food-wise, it\\'s excellent just like in any other The Keg location. Menu seems to be identical in most locations I\\'ve been to in Toronto. We tried their \"Holiday Features\" (special limited-time items) shareable sides, Caesar Brussels Sprouts and Asparagus with Spiced Hollandaise, and they were both super delectable - two of our favourite sides of the night (especially the Caesar Brussels Sprouts - crispy to perfection). For the mains, we ordered Lobster Tail Dinner and Mediterranean Cauliflower. The Lobster Tail Dinner came as 2 large lobster tails that easily slid off the shells. They were tender and perfect. It came with mushroom rice (just okay) and seasonal vegetables (steamed green beans and beets). The Mediterranean Cauliflower was my favourite main dish of the night. It consisted of oven-roasted cauliflower, green garbanzo bean hummus, couscous, pistachio nuts, and tahini lemon sauce. It was SO delicious! The Keg wins for a steakhouse serving the best vegetarian dishes on the menu. I\\'d definitely get this again the next time I visit The Keg. The sides of baked potato, fresh vegetables, mushroom rice, and sautéed mushrooms were all pretty good as well, but the holiday feature items / specials (Caesar Brussels Sprouts and Asparagus) were still the winners. ** SERVICE ** Great service - no complaints. Our server was attentive and brought things out exactly as asked. We were left to enjoy our meal without disturbance, and we were able to get their attention when needed. Nice overall dining experience with helpful staff all around.',\n",
              " 'Dining at The Keg Mansion is THE experience. It does not matter which room or which corner you are seated. It has very charming decor and lighting of old mansion that makes you feel very comfortable. Ordered Never Fail staple food items. Bread and Garlic Butter - We tried our best not to finish the bread before we get all the food we ordered but that garlic butter was too good. Classic Wedge Salad($13) - Very generous amount of blue cheese! Whole Lobster ($60) - Around 2LB whole lobster that was perfectly cooked. Not overdone at all. When dipped in butter, it is the heaven. Think whole lobster is available during \"The Keg Lobster Summer\" Prime Rib 10oz($38) - Again perfect medium rare, so juicy, marbled with fat & tender. Went great with red wine jus, garlic mash & onion crisp. Don\\'t underestimate horse radish. It can make your sinuses explode! Lol. Daily Special Rose Sangria($6) - They had three different sangria and none of them were made with wine. My rose sangria was made with absolute citron vodka. I did not mind at all. Billy Miner Pie($10) - It was complementary. Even though we did not have room for a dessert anymore somehow we finished it. It was that good!! Dinner took a total of 1.5 hours. Serving timing was great even though it was a busy night. Only thing bother me with the service was after we finished main meal because of messiness it can get after cracking the whole lobster, there were small bits of lobster food debris everywhere on the table. Wait staff brought the dessert plate without quickly wiping the table and placed it on top of lobster bits on the table. I could not stop the staff and requested to wipe the table first because dessert had candle with the light on. We ended up wiping the table with dessert napkins provided. That was a little disappointing. Overrall we had a great dinner at the Keg Mansion. Having a plenty of parking spots were a bonus as well.',\n",

Each dish was so unique and packed with layers of complex flavoured that mixed well together. My personal favourite was definitely the fried watermelon! A super interesting combination done incredibly well: the texture of the fried exterior with the salty meat floss combined with the juicy and sweet refreshing watermelon was truly amazing. Each dish was delicately paired with different wines, all of which I enjoyed thoroughly. I definitely recommend getting the premium taste menu over the regular one. For just $20 more you can get more samples from the kitchen + a bigger dish at the very end (in our case it was the fish!) For the service, it was absolutely amazing as well. Each server took the time to explain the origin of ingredients, the flavour profiles of the dish, and how to eat it! All the servers were so sweet and attentive which made the whole experience so much better. The vibes of this place were very relaxed yet sophisticated, we thoroughly enjoyed it.

Crispy octopus tacos: I thought the jicama \"shell\" was nice and gave a very refreshing crispy texture. The octopus was amazingggg and very tender. Rice and hakka pork: very reminiscent of asian style braised pork belly. The pork was an extra 5 bucks Smoked duck bokkeum: it was topped with small pieces of vegetables, gochugaru onion jam, and a few pieces of crispy wild rice. The jam was slightly sweet which paired nicely with the meet  topped with sweet jam. It has also had bits of asparagus and carrots The dumpling and tacos were my favourite. The smoked duck bokkeum was decent but is quite expensive for the portion tbh, I wish they had more vegetables or sides accompanying the dish. The rice dish is good for filling up on since the other portions are small. Overall I felt while it was good, the price is quite steep.

Our server was very gracious and thoroughly descriptive when it came to the wines/sake paired with. Everything was very delicious! I'd say this place is Asian fusion, or a modern take on Asian dishes. There's a lot of mixture in flavors like spicy/sweet/sour, plus a variety of textures from soft to crunchy to some toothy bite. Do the tasting if you're adventurous and wanna try it all! My favorite was perhaps the smoked fish/leaf, just fold it like a taco and you get a lovely mix of fresh green with soft smoky fish!

The dumpling course was also great and enjoyable. The final course was where we were disappointed - included the fried trout and choy dish. The choy was great but the fried trout was difficult to eat. We didn't feel satisfied at the end of our meal and didn't find that it was worth the tasting menu price.

I love the vibe here, most seatings are booths (very tiny ones, so it's great for 2 but super tight for 4 people) but the set up looks like a pub in Japan! The servers were also very attentive as well! My bf and I decided to try their Aburi sushi, Gyu tataki (lightly seared beef) , beef tenderloin skewers, pork neck skewers and oysters karaage. Overall, I found the prices to be a little steep as all the dishes were average and nothing to run home about. My least favourite being their Gyu tataki. Pretty much flavourless. The only flavour came from the onions that the beef was sitting on, but the meat itself had no flavour. 2/5. My favourite would be their oysters karaage, the batter was a bit too thick for my liking however, the flavours were good especially when mixed in with their house made mayo. 3.5/5 The polar beer float was definitely the highlight for me, it was Sapporo topped with a swirl of icy beer. Very unique, very delicious, can't go wrong with Sapporo! Probably won't get this every time, because at the end of the day it still just taste like a regular Sapporo... just colder. But I think it was worth the experience. 5/5 Overall, come here for a chill date with friends for their drinks and the vibe but don't expect much from their food.\",\n",

There are really interesting miscarriage that are cut over charcoal and really get that smoky flavor that is true to Japan. TLDR way better than Kinka for toronto Izakaya. I found a sushi to be superior quality in so many other restaurants that specialize in sushi. The nigiri pieces had quite generous serving, and I would even consider it almost 2 pieces of another restaurant. There is a large selection of drinks and beers as well that really brings through the Japanese Izakaya.

The water pump was interesting, at least I had it on my table where you can pump your own water. No need to ask for a server (unless you ran out of water in that pitcher). Tsukune - Nope. Beef was overcooked for my liking. Maguro Tataki - Love it! Lightly seared properly. Ika Yaki - Love it! There's that strong ika taste that tasted with the food. Japango Roll - Love it! I'm a sucker for aburi rolls. 3 kinds sashimi - I got salmon, tuna, and torched butterfish for my 3 kinds. It was good overall. Oden soup - Meh. Nothing special. Service was good here.

We had - Chicken Karaage - Deep fried Soft Shell crab - Beef tataki - Sashimi (Salmon & Hamachi) - Beef tongue skewer With Asahi Superdry, warm sake, and a few cocktails. Their deep-fried foods were good though the Karaage was a bit dry, with a lot of small pieces. Soft shell crabs had good meaty parts, and I liked them. The beef tataki was ok but the sauce was mysteriously sweet - I expected that tataki to come with sauce with a hint of sourness. I found the sashimi pieces were too thick, ignoring each fish\\'s unique delicacy. I did not like their presentation of sashimi with \"thicker the better\" thinking. I expected that each fish be cut at an appropriate thickness to maximize the unique character, and the hamachi could be better if it was thinner with more slices. But I should not expect such delicacy in this casual Izakaya-like place. I wanted the Asahi to be served chillier. It lost hoppiness and crispness when it was served. Their warm sake was not served at the appropriate temperature - under-warmed, and losing the alcohol punch.

The place has a very cozy vibe, with pretty dim lighting making it somewhat intimate for some good convo. Their menu, as with many other izakayas offers something for everyone. Ordered the takowasa ($9), tori karaage ($15), ebi mayo ($15) and mochi bacon ($7.5) along with the nama grapefruit ($12) and yuzu soda ($15) cocktails. Personal favorites were the ebi mayo and mochi bacon. The ebi mayo was actually very well done, large prawns with a bit of spice. Probably wouldn't get the karaage again since it just lacked flavour (even with the mayo). But everything else was pretty average. Jack of all trades kind of place. Strictly on food it'd be 3 stars but the cocktails I thought were really nice, light and easy to drink, making it a 4 star for me. They didn't really mix it when it got to the table but after a stir the flavors are great. Highly recommend both the cocktails!

This was the perfect amount of food, we struggled to finish the last piece. If I was very hungry I could've taken down the sashimi platter myself but I wasn't feeling heroic tonight. The restaurant serves two different types of soy sauces for the sushi. One specifically for the red fish and the other for all others. In the middle was flaked salt, I didn't catch what that was for, probably the wagyu? Wifey ate all hers and helped herself to mine.

Everything was beautifully presented, carrying the clean yet elegant decor of the space onto the food. The chawanmushi was steamed flawlessly with the flavors of the uni and kura coming through. It was small yet filling. The pressed sushi though was the highlight. Each bite of melt in your mouth deliciousness made me want to order more even though  I was full. No soy sauce or extras needed. I did trade one of my jabistrolls for one of my friend's hotate since I love scallops. I think my favorite was the wagyu since I'm addicted to anything with yakiniku sauce and the beef was like butter.

              " '\"Do you want to try the pork one or the chicken one?\", I asked the little ones (I was referring to the two Ikkoushas along Queen Street). I was secretly hoping that they would choose the chicken one (two doors down) because I\\'ve already tried the original Ikkousha four years ago when they first opened.  Even though I walked away impressed back then, I\\'ve been longing to try their chicken ramen, but is almost never in the area. Four years later, I walked away satisfied, but not as impressed.  Reasons?  Maybe, the novelty has worn off?  Perhaps Toronto\\'s ramen game have really stepped up in the past four years or my kids didn\\'t order what I would have liked.  Nonetheless, they still delivered a solid ramen. My favourite part of their ramen is their noodles (4 years ago it was the soup).  It\\'s a skinnier type of noodle with a good chew to it.  The god fire ramen that my older one ordered was quite spicy even at two chilies.  They didn\\'t lie about it being extremely spicy.  I can\\'t even imagine what four chillies would be like.  Aside from the heat, the tonkotsu soup was rich.  I generally liked it, but it\\'s just a bit out of my comfort level. My younger one ordered a shio tonkotsu ramen.  I\\'m not sure if it\\'s because he ordered the light version of the soup, the soup was lacking a bit of flavour and was heavy on white pepper taste.  I was really holding out hope that I could ditch my family temporarily to try the chicken place.  That\\'s why I paid $2.50 to add noodles to one of my kid\\'s bowl so that I won\\'t be completely full.  I ended up blending the two soups for mine so that I can enhance the flavour and reduce the heat. I have no recollection of the portions from four years ago, but their normal noodle portion and the extra noodle add on were quite generous.  Just when I thought the hope of me escaping to the chicken place was dashed, an ethereal, pure, but yet familiar voice asked, \"can I have some of the noodles from my brother\\'s bowl (as the younger one was struggling to finish his bowl), dad (meaning I don\\'t have to fulfil my daddy duty of finishing my kids\\' leftover)? \". The glimmer of hope resurfaced and I knew that was my cue to ask my SO whether I can excuse myself (for those who are interested, check out my Ikkousha Ramen Chicken review). When I returned, I was at least able to try a one bite gyoza that my SO ordered after I left.  The pan frying was done well, the flavour is solid, but I wish it had a slightly meatier texture.  After that of course I happily footed the bill and everyone went home happy (or at least daddy got what he wanted...so I\\'m happy).',\n",
              " \"As I was waiting for my ramen at the bar seating, I was studying the map that shows all the locations of Ikkousha globally.  I was dumbfounded by the fact that the number of outlets in Indonesia significantly outnumbered the two measly locations in Toronto given the multicultural nature of our city. I guess I shouldn't be so surprised since Indonesia has the geographic proximity and the low cost of operation advantages. As with a lot of ramen places, options at Ikkousha is pretty limited, you will end up with one of four ramen: tonkotsu, shio, black tonkotsu or gods fire. I resorted to the most common option which was the tonkotsu. The ramen came piping hot which was perfect for a nice chilly day.  The soup had a clean but strong, pleasant porky broth; not overly heavy or salty like many places despite ordering the normal version.  I think the soup is the main attraction of Ikkousha ramen. The noodle was good but not exceptional IMO.  It was definitely homemade but I didn't feel it was anything special. They had char su that's the lean variety; I personally prefer the one with the rings of fat. The taste of the pork was good but not tough despite how lean it was. I would say their intent was to showcase the subtle,fresh taste of the quality pork they use. The thing I would lament is that most toppings cost money here. If I happen to be in the area, I wouldn't mind dropping by Ikkousha again or even venture a few doors down to try their chicken focused ramen subsidiary. But in my eyes they are not the best ramen outlet in Toronto.\",\n",
              " \"Nice ramen place! We came here on a weekday only about 20 mins after opening but it was also completely packed! Totally unexpected, so definitely plan your trip if you can. I heard lots of this place being super delicious, but perhaps it was the god fire broth I chose that don't quite meet my expectations. The broth felt oily/fatty in a non-pleasant way, where it coated the inside of my mouth and felt like it stuck to my lips if licked them. The flavour itself was very nice, but it was the feeling of it that I found a bit unpleasant. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth delicious though! Definitely recommend getting the premium toppings to get extra pork and a delicious ramen egg. One thing I thought was odd was the noodles--they feel like a thin egg noodle vs. a ticker ramen noodle. The noodles are good, but didn't quite meet my expectation of ramen. I may come back to try again, or visit one of their other global locations, but probably not anytime soon.\",\n",

To start we had the jerk chips and dip - ultra-crisp chips made from plantains and taro were great on their own with their jerk seasoning, but the dual dips of spicy aioli and mango-pineapple gave great island flavours. For her main, my wife had the mixed greens and mango salad, with added jerk chicken. This bright and flavourful salad was just what my wife was looking for, and the wood-fire-grilled jerk chicken added some flavourful heft to the dish. My oxtail stew was a deeply savoury dish. The fatty meat on the oddly-shaped bones was wonderfully tender, and the I eagerly spooned the rich sauce into the rice and peas. Service was chill and friendly, but still new their stuff. Jamaican food gets a chef-y touch that ups their game above your typical mom-and-pop shop, while the space itself is welcoming and warm without any of the pretension of many new and hip places.\",\n",
              " \"The ackee and saltfish bites ($16 for 3, $3 for an extra piece) would make a great hors d'oeuvre. The fried dumpling base is like a fluffy biscuit topped with a mound of creamy ackee and saltfish spread studded with sweet peppers, onions, and tomatoes. It reminds me of a more fluid crab cake with a pop of freshness. The pepper shrimp ($19) still knocked a fiery punch bringing on the scotch bonnet zing while swimming in garlic butter. The sauce seemed much thicker, so it really sticks to the seafood or acts as a dip for the crunchy bread. I wish the kitchen had served the mixed green and mango salad ($17) with the shrimp (instead of with the mains) as it had a refreshing coolness that would have helped tame the spicy shrimp. Ultimately, it's a salad, which was light on the mango but had some tropical flair from toasted coconut chips. Oddly, the jerk pork ($24) was completely devoid of the spice and heat you'd expect and tasted like regular barbeque meat. If anything, my favourite part of the dish was the sauteed greens made from kale, collard greens, cherry tomato, and onion. It's a side that would go great with anything. As with the previous visit, Chubby's saucier dishes continue to impress. While I would have liked more heat in the curry chicken ($19), it was nonetheless tender and flavourful, pairing well with the jasmine rice and pineapple chutney. The gravy from the oxtail stew ($25) was also on point, and pairs well with side dishes like the rice and peas and as a dip for the fried okra ($11). The oxtail was a tad scant on the meat, but what was included was flavourful and tender. I could easily have an entire order of this to myself. Chubby's smartly leaves the fried plantain ($10.50) in large chunks, so they don't dry out. They were the best plantains I've ever had, a slight crispiness outside yielding to the soft fruit, with a sprinkling of salt that enhanced its semi-sweetness. In fact, with a scoop of coconut ice cream and a caramel drizzle, the fried plantains could even sub in for dessert. Consequently, much tastier than the cornmeal pudding ($12), which was too salty and had a non-existent 'pudding' element. If anything, the dessert was merely a piece of corn bread covered with fussy corn nuts and a scoop of mellow coconut sorbet.\",\n",
              " \"The ambiance and music was great. I really liked the decor of the place as well. However, we came for the food. I've eaten at several Jamaican restaurants which were more casual than this one all over the GTA , and I expected better from Chubby's. The jerk chicken was tender but didn't pack a lot of flavour. The coleslaw on the side tasted very vinegary, there were 3 of us that had it and all of us struggled to finish it... My friend had the goat curry and there was a lot more bone than goat. We also got a side of rice with peas and it was a little dry. The better items on the menu were the jerk wings (the cornbread being the star of that dish), and the fried plantain. I don't know how my friend's drinks were, but I got the Havana Nights cocktail. It was strong but I would have liked a dash of sweetness in there for variety as the flavours in there are mostly bitter with a bit of sour. Service was a little slow, we had to ask to get our water refilled.\",\n",
              " \"Chubby's serves elevated Jamaican food in a cozy interior with romantic lighting perfect for dates! I tried their ackee and saltfish bites, jerk chicken and oxtail stew with a side of slaw. The bites were a bit too salty for me (I should have expected it though so that's on me). The jerk chicken and oxtail stew were tender and packed with flavour. Portions are smaller than expected, but remember you're also paying for the atmosphere/ambiance here. I recommend getting the slaw with your dishes, it really helped balance things out (and get some veggies in!)\",\n",
              " \"We arrived at 10pm on a Saturday night and scored a table right away. With most of the tables still occupied and people were still arriving after us, we know we got lucky. What we got: Fried Okra Pepper Shrimp Jerk Pork Oxtail Stew Service was friendly and quick, we were vibin with the music, and the food was delicious! Fried okra has a slightly sweet sauce. The pepper shrimp had a big kick but was still enjoyable. The jerk pork's sauce was slightly thick in a good way that it stuck to the meat with most of the pieces tender. It was accompanied by some of their seasonal sautéed greens that I really enjoyed. The oxtail stew's sauce was a bit too liquidy that the flavors didnt stick to the meat as much as I'd like but the meat itself was soft and tender.\",\n",
              " 'While searching for Caribbean food in Toronto, this place had the most appetizing menu, cool-vibey pictures, and perfect location. We walked-in and put our name on the list. Since it was an hour wait, we walked around the area. When we got the text that our table was ready, we headed over. Upon arriving, no one greeted us. It took 10 minutes before a manager came to us. He then told us that there was a big party upstairs and he doesn\\'t know when they are leaving and the kitchen is closing in 30 minutes?? I said okay then I\\'ll order at the bar. Suddenly, a table \"opened up.\" For reference: there was not a single big party there that night. He was trying to get us to leave. Even once we were sat down, we had to stand up and ask a waiter to take our order. I came for the food and I wasn\\'t going to leave without it. Service was definitely 1 star or 0, if that\\'s possible. The food, however, was 5 stars. The pepper shrimp was hands down the most flavorful and spicy carribean shrimp I\\'ve ever eaten. We also ordered the ackee and salt fish bites. These fried dumplings dipped in the pepper shrimps sauce was all the dumplings needed to be elevated to the next level. The jerk chicken was basic jerk chicken. It just wasn\\'t very filling.',\n",
              " \"Considering the downtown location, unique cuisine choice for the area, and the great ambience I have to give Chubby's an extra star. However on food alone, it would be a 3 star for me. We came on a Friday evening without reservations and was promptly seated in the back patio tucked in a quiet corner which was perfect for us. They had plenty of tables, but looked to be reserved by multiple large parties and the night continued. I would recommend booking a table as it does get busy. Our server was friendly and helpful, recommending oxtail stew over the curry goat while my partner ordered the small jerk chicken. Great flavors for both with the appropriate spice levels. Only complaint is that the portions are 1/3 of what I'm use to in the suburbs at almost double the price. However, given the King West location that is to be expected. Also, my goat was a touch too salty for my palate, would definitely need something acidic and bright to balance it out next time.\",\n",

The pepperoni was a bit too burnt, but I guess it had to be so that everything cooks well. I thought it was interesting that the sauce is a dollop onto the pie. Although I'm more of a crust person, the edges were crispy and tasted delicious. I got the garlic parmesan aioli and it was so good!

              " \"While we were traveling to  we didn't have time to stop in Detroit for some Detroit style pizza, so while we were in Toronto we thought... this city is closer to Detroit than our home is! After reading good reviews  about Descendant, we decided to give it a try. The service here was fast, friendly and enjoyable. The server had a smile on her face and lots of knowledge about the menu and she steered us towards ordering the Truff guy. I cross referenced that with seeing it was also one of their most popular and most reviewed pizzas and choose to order it. We ordered one side with their double smoked bacon how it normally comes and one side without since my fiancé doesn't usually like bacon. Funny thing is after eating the first slice and letting him try a taste of mine he soon wanted to have more of the original recipe with the bacon haha. It was doughy, cheesy, had a crispy outer edge, and we dipped it in some of their sauces which were good. I felt like it was a close re creation of good Detroit style pizza, we were happy with our decision to come here.\",\n",
              " \"I discovered Descendant Detroit Style Pizza early this year. I have had pizza from this establishment a couple of times. The first time, I got the Truff-guy. I loved it so much that I got it again recently. When I love a menu item, I tend to get it on repeat to the point where I neglect the other items. It's the case when I'm at Gushi. It's now the case here. I dig Detroit-style pizza. The cheese layer is at the bottom of the pizza and the sauce is on top. It's different. Perhaps it's peculiar to folks who are used to the reverse. Live a little. It's yummy. This eatery is in Leslieville. I dropped by in the evening both times. All Green P parking spots on both sides of Queen Street East were packed. Instead, I drove up Jones Avenue a bit and had better luck. I now parallel park on this street and don't even bother trying on Queen Street East. Parking is free along Jones Avenue. Technically, you do need a parking permit if you are parking overnight. However, if you're there for an hour or two, you're fine parking in the evening. Staff have always been friendly and helpful. The first time, I walked in and placed my order for the Truff-guy, which has everything that I love: - Cheese blend - Caramelized onions - Truffle aioli - Roasted garlic cremini mushrooms - Grana padano cheese - Double-smoked bacon - Lemon zest - Fresh thyme I learned my first time that it would take thirty minutes to bake my small pizza. You can't rush perfection. I decided to roam around the neighbourhood to kill some time. It was wonderful getting acquainted with the neighbourhood. On my most recent visit, I called ahead and placed my order. By the time I had arrived, my pizza was ready. If you want to avoid waiting, this option is for you. I paid with a debit card and tipped both times. The transactions were seamless and a breeze. There are seats on the main floor, but they do fill up fast. Both times, I ended up eating in my car. The original thought was to drive home and eat. However, my car smelled so good that I could resist but to devour everything immediately. The Truff-guy pizza is my jam. If you are a huge mushroom fan, you must try it. I love mushrooms and the roasted garlic creminis were so good. There was enough garlic that you tasted it and it mildly lingered after I had eaten my pizza. You definitely get a cheese pull when you grab your first piece of pizza. It was cool. Because you don't see the cheese on top of the pizza, it was a nice surprise seeing cheese strings coming from the middle of the slice. The double-smoked bacon was enough to know that you had a meat protein, but you knew that the mushrooms were the stars of this pizza. Delicious! The pizza was bright with the lemon zest and thyme. You do need to pay attention to the caramelized onions. They don't hit you at full force. Rather, they are subtle. The truffle aioli was fantastic. I could put it on anything that I eat and be the happiest person ever. You do need a drink to wash everything down. I had a bottle of lemon iced tea the first time and a cold can of Diet Coke the second. Both work well and pair nicely with this pizza. This pizza is filling. I first thought that I was full after my second slice. However, the first slice was so good that I polished off the remaining slices. The crust had a good crunch while still being chewy. It was perfectly balanced. It also didn't feel carb-heavy. I never felt sluggish driving home with pizza stuffed in me both times. It you want to save some money staying in Toronto for Detroit-style pizza instead of crossing the border to search for an authentic version, come here. You and your appetite will be fully satisfied.

We went around lunch time and the place was pretty empty - more of a take-out spot. We ordered: Truff-Guy A large size of 8 pieces, this pizza was loaded with caramelized onions, mushrooms, bacon and truffle aioli. We mainly ordered this for the truffle but found it very mild to nonexistent. The pizza itself was large and super thick. We enjoyed the cheese and amount of toppings, but the pizza needed some extra flavour - honey, hot sauce and chilli - after a few bites. The large size was a lot for two people, super filling and we for sure had left overs. Overall, this spot was definitely something new to try for pizzas.

It is good food that isn't overly priced, and they were all consistently good. My friend's highlight was the shrimp al ajillo, while my favorite was the grilled mushroom with cured egg yolk and foie gras. The bone marrow was great, but I wish there was a bit more flavor to it. My friends also enjoyed the octopus, but I think I've come to realize over the years that I'm just not a fan of grilled octopus in general. The shishito peppers were very simply but very well done. The sea bream ceviche could use more fish but tasted good. And the basque cake was great. It was quite sweet, but it was weirdly easy to eat at the same time.

Service is quite friendly and efficient (but keep in mind there is a mandatory 20% service charge). There have been times when it gets really busy and service can be a little slow. They are most well-known for their Spanish tapas but I personally find their larger dishes to be better than some of the smaller tapas. My personal fav dishes are their Octopus (MUST-TRY) and Picanha Steak (perfectly cooked), and Basque Cake (ugh it's so so decadent). Some plates I didn't love were the snow pea leaves (tastes like Chinese-style snow pea leaves but for 1/4 the value) and the mussels (again, very very small portion for the price - I think we got 6 mussels for $12). The ceviche, croqueta and patatas bravas are pretty average and you can't really go wrong with them. I would definitely recommend this spot for a date night or with a small group of friends!

And the more substantial dishes consisted of the Bone Marrow, Picahna Steak, Patatas Bravas (homefries), and Seabream Ceviche. The sourdough bread was very standard, nothing to write home about. The slices of Coppo, which we were told were from the pig neck, was a nice cured meat but wasn\\'t too special imo. The croquettes were PHENOMENAL! By far my favourite single bite of the night. Super creamy, rich, and decadent coated in a crispy shell. Definitely recommend the croquettes. The bone marrow was a bit underwhelming in taste and plating. It\\'s served with charred bread, a chimichurri, and sea salt. It was good, but it didn\\'t wow. The patatas bravas was a plate of \"homefries\" garnished with spring onions and sauces. I thought they were quite tasty and the sauces reminded me a bit like Indian masala. The sea bream ceviche was really tasty, refreshing, light and added levity to the meal. We ordered the large size and it had enough filling to share for 4 however did not have enough chips to portion. The steak was well seasoned and cooked to a nice medium temp. It is served with caramelized onions that paired well with the cuts of steak. Overall, the food was good quality and some dishes were really tasty but did not really wow me (apart from the croquettes). DRINKS (2.5/5) Bar Isabel is ranked fairly highly in bars in  and Toronto so we had high expectations going in. We ordered the Rambla Highball, Barragana and the house Vermut. The rambla highball was nice and refreshing and a bit sweet. The Barragana was surprisingly offputting. They use a sage infused base that is SUPER strong and turns the drink very herbacious and the added jalapeno makes it simultaneously spicy. Amongst my group, we did not enjoy it. Lastly the vermut was pretty standard. Even after consulting with the waiter perhaps we ordered drinks not fit for our palette but it left much to be desired. AMBIENCE (3/5) The restaurant is overall quite dim with red lighting for effect to give a bit of a tavern feel. There is decor throughout to add to the tavern-esque look. I\\'d say it is a more unique ambience heightened when it gets busy and feels more lively. I must say though it is a bit impractical because often we found it was hard to read the menu or properly appreciate the looks of the food. SERVICE (5/5) Staff were very friendly and overall helpful with understanding the menu. They also came by multiple times to refill our water even though we could\\'ve done it ourselves. There is however a mandatory 20% gratuity fee for all dine in guests. I do appreciate that the payment machine did not prompt for additional tip which could\\'ve lead guests to accidentally tip twice. ACCESSIBILITY (5/5) Bar Isabel is directly on College Street in the West end and directly accessible by streetcar. There is also paid street parking on College as well as a parking lot for the neighbouring Metro that is also paid. PRICE (2.5/5) The prices is a bit on the higher end but you do get your money\\'s worth in terms of freshness and quality of ingredients. OVERALL (3/5) Bar Isabel provides good quality tapas style foods in a tavern-esque environment. Really recommend trying as a group, but be prepared to spend a decent amount to sample the different foods and be full. I wouldn\\'t mind returning but at this pricepoint I may feel more comfortable frequenting some other options in the downtown core.',\n",

I'm not sure if it's maybe just my luck but out of the four times I've been here, not one time was th service even above average. Each time I'm here we are always waiting a long time on service or asking for water. The fastest service is when the bill comes. Not sure if anyone else has had better experiences here with the staff?\",\n",
              " \"Excited for this place since I always see it on Instagram. My boyfriend and I here came here for dinner and decided to share the 45 day aged ribeye, grilled mushroom with cured egg yolk and jamon croqueta. We also decided to order a house cocktail. The dry aged steak was probably one of the steaks I've had! The meat was very tender and savory with a nice hint of smokiness. I also really enjoyed the mushrooms and egg yolk dish. It was super flavorful and the egg yolk added an extra layer of flavour. The croqueta was also creamy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Overall really enjoyed all the dishes here (definitely on the more expensive side)! Service was great as well!\",\n",
              " \"A cozy place on the western part of College Street near Ossington. Due to the streetcar constriction (hope it will finish soon!) , the access was a bit tricky at this time, but in spite of this, the restaurant was FULL of people by 6:30pm (Friday). I am glad I made a reservation. Was a perfect place to catch up with my girlfriend with great food and drinks after busy weekdays. Even though the place was busy - the a dimly lit interior somewhat gave us a sense of privacy. The service was excellent. Our server was very good at giving details about the menu to us, his descriptions/suggestions were so good that I wanted to order almost every dish he mentioned! He was also friendly and attentive. We (two) had the following dishes: Food: Shishito Peppers Sea Bream Ceviche & Chips Grilled Octopus (Quarter) Roast Veal Bone Marrow Drink: Isabel Fashioned ¡Rebujito! And some draft beer and local craft beers. Impressed by the Roast Veal Bone Marrow. The melty bone marrow came with toasted multigrain sourdough & refreshing Parsley Verde & good quality sea salt. Each item was simple, but eating together - soooo good! Loved this. The grilled octopus was excellent as well. Tender, perfectly seasoned, and goes very well with butter sauce with a hint of sourness. Eating with the sautéed dandelion underneath the octopus gives another layer of flavor (nice bitterness). Enjoyed this, thank you!!! The shishito was nicely seasoned, fried perfectly leaving the plumpness/crispiness of the peppers. They weren't too pungent or overly salty at all. I loved the shaved salt sprinkled around the peppers. Sea Bream Ceviche was the least favorite food of the night, but they are still good. Just felt that it is not worth the price. Will come back for sure, this is a place for the well executed food and excellent service!\",\n",

The past few times I've been here, they either ran out or weren't serving my favorite Foie Gras Toast (cured meat, honey and shaved truffle on a crunchy bread ?). But this time I made sure to call in advance and reserve an order, which ended up being the very last one of the night. Grilled Mushrooms & Cured Egg Yolk: This was pretty good, the egg yolk had a bit of rich/saltiness and the mushrooms were grilled nicely Quarter Octopus: This just ended up being 1.5 tentacles (about 6 pieces of octopus) and was $32 :/ Roast Veal Bone Marrow: Can't really go wrong with this accompanied with a side of tangy chimmichuri sauce Cured Chorizo (?): Buttery and full of flavor, one of my favorite cuts of cured meat Foie Gras with Peaches: This was really tasty, the peaches were sweet and caramalized and the foie gras was slightly salty, rich and buttery. The food is pretty much the same as before except the prices are higher cause inflation. I also noticed resos aren't as hard to snag as they used to be which is a plus, and walk ins generally have zero wait time now. For a very casual dinner, it was over $200 including 1 alcoholic beverage. I honestly find it quite steep now for some items\",\n",

              " \"My friend invited me to try this place before they closed down for renovations. The staff knew their menu well and have good recommendations when it comes to which drink goes well with what dish. We ordered the deluxe bento box which is like a sampler set of nine dishes, the nigiri special, the tiger prawn tartare, the beef tongue, a bottle of sake, yuzu G&T, Moscow mule, and the Doraemon drink. 1) Bento Box I don't remember which dishes came in the set but I really enjoyed the ebi mayo the most. I believe it also came with karaage, salmon, beef, corn, and others. There's enough food to share with another person as well. 2) Nigiri Special The fish they used is from Taro Fish. Not much to say except for it being fresh. The Nigiri already has wasabi added to it so it doesn't come with any on the side. The tuna tataki bowl was also pretty good. 3) Tiger Prawn Tartare The dish comes with garlic toast and the tartare is mixed with avocado. It was quite lovely and I enjoyed the garlic toast. 4) Beef Tongue I've never really tried this before and it was unexpected. I did find the meat to be slightly salty but the sauce it came with complements the beef tongue well. 5) Drinks The bottle of sake we ordered was recommended by the staff as it pairs well with the fish on their nigiri plate. The cocktails were regular but I liked the yuzu g&t the most. The food is what you'd expect from an izakaya and a bit on the pricier side too. But I would come back and try their noodles next time since I didn't get the chance to. The service was good, the food came pretty quickly and the server was attentive.\",\n",
              " \"This place is so cute, and I can't wait to come back! I just wish it wasn't situated in a quieter part of town because I'm so used to downtown core. But I'll trek out to come here again. Really nice and cozy vibes, great to meet friends or for a date. My friend and I really came here for the bento after seeing it on IG multiple times. It was a really nice and tasty experience seeing what each block was/contained and then trying it. Each part was delicious and it was like a mini omakase experience but definitely without the $$$ price tag (it was $35). I had some friends comment on my IG story about how it looks like places you'd find in Vancouver! Their bento does change, so I would definitely go back We also ordered an eel roll which I don't remember the name now. It was really delicious but there was some type of leaf in the roll that my friend and I both didn't like -- the taste was quite overpowering unfortunately. I did see the tables around us also order the bento box in addition to actually getting some grilled products so I'd love to come back and try to grill things. This is one place I'd actively go back to Cabbagetown for!\",\n",
              " \"An amazing izakaya that really focuses on great food with fresh ingredients. The beer and cocktail menu has a lot of variety and I liked that they had creative non-alcoholic cocktails too. I'm very sad to see they are closing for renovations and rebranding on Nov 1, but have faith that the management will re-open with something wonderful with a bit of Kingyo's old charm. If you want to enjoy the original Kingyo menu, better book a table ASAP. There's a 2 hour eating limit. So you can't stay here all night but that's good news for waiting list people to know tables will open up at regular intervals. The vibe is very chill and the servers are so friendly. We ordered a lot of food and she paced everything so well. The next wave of dishes came out only when we were done what was in front of us. We started with the hot stone beef tongue. I love tabletop cooking and the beef was sliced nice and thin. The stone's temperature was enough to slightly sear and cook it tenderly without turning it rubbery. The server was happy to bring another stone if it got too cold to continue cooking. Pressed sushi came next. Saba is my favorite fish and the sushi portion here was very meaty! The rice was just the right amount. Spicy Toro was ok. I think the spicy sauce overpowered the tuna and I couldn't taste much else. It's the one thing I probably would not order again. The Makunouchi bento is very popular and one of their signature menu items. Lots of little dishes to sample a variety of traditional Japanese flavors. This on its own is good for just snacking on while drinking with your buddies. My favorites were the miso glazed grill fish, fried ebi, and deep fried tofu nuggets. It's possible the dishes in the box differ from the printout, and your server will tell you in advance what was substituted. Our chirashi came last and at this point I was happy they were mini! Topped with fresh seafood and beautifully presented. I enjoyed what I could but had to ask for a box to eat the rest at home. They surprised us with complimentary ice cream and strawberries as a gift for our anniversary! It was a very nice way to end off the night. For the ladies: their washrooms have complimentary grooming and hygiene items to help you freshen up!\",\n",
              " 'Mini Sea Urchin & Snow Crab Chirashi - Apparenlty I missed the word \"mini\" because when this dish came out I was shocked at how small it was. It was my first time having Uni! Very creamy, but there was a noticable fishy after taste (which my friend said is quite normal). Stone Bowl Eel Unagi Don: one of the best eel rice bowls I\\'ve had! They topped it with egg omelet, takana, dried seaweed, and scallions and it really elevated the dish a made a huge difference in terms of texture and flavour. Kaarage: Really juicy and tender, I enjoyed this, and wish it came with more than 3 pieces! Sushi: we got 4 different types, I honestly don\\'t remember all the names. These were decent but the rice wasn\\'t packed tight enough as it kept breaking when we tried to pick it up. The fish was on the softer and fishier side then I prefer. Kingyo has recently announced they will be restructuring their restaurant and menu starting November 1st so you can look forward to new dishes when they re-open!',\n",
              " \"Yea things have changed since the dine-in days haven't they? Forget about what the server said, how you didn't get your water glass filled right away, now it's all about the FOOD! There's a massive menu on-line where you can buy whole fish, fresh or frozen, etc., but I grabbed a small paper menu from the counter which is accessible inside the restaurant where you will be greeted by a friendly server. I scanned the menu and the (Lunch Only) lined grabbed my attention and it was Beef Fillet Steak Bento, hmmm, that sounded fine at $19. They said to give them 30 minutes at noon on a Friday, so I went for a stroll around Cabbagetown, trying not to stray too far. Right on the dot I was back and my meal was ready, boom! The steak was fantastic! It was great to have a meal like this as a takeaway. The sides were tasty as well, with a tuna salad, chef's dish, and pickles, according to the menu. See my closeup pics for more details. The chef's knife skills made for a gorgeous looking bento box, and the subtle charring of the veg and steak introduced a nice smoky flavour from the hibachi. This place is sooooo good I want to go back again soon and try more items like the Makunouchi Bento $25, or the Kaisen version for $24. Maybe someone out there can point me to other items good for a lunch meal from this menu as everything is reasonably priced and I'm sure will be over the top good!\",\n",
              " \"We went on Monday evening for dinner for two, a couple of months ago. To our surprise, a lot of the Izakayas were closed on Monday. So we decided to venture out to the east end to satisfy our cravings. Atmosphere & Service: There's a bit of construction happening at the restaurant storefront, so we did have a bit of difficulty finding the main entrance around the maze of scaffolding. The restaurant floor area was larger than I had expected. Divided in essentially three different zones - two of which are near the open kitchen. The other is surrounded by vintage Japanese slot machines on the walls. The servers here are friendly and extremely attentive. Food & Taste: We ordered 5 different dishes and created our own mini omakase. Our order: - Kingyo Bento ($35) - Could be a cute order for date night. The bento includes 9 different appetizers ranging from sashimi, fried seafood, steamed egg, grilled fish, beef tartare, etc. I believe the bento changes on a daily basis. - Red Tuna Carpaccio ($9.80) - Full of flavour with complementary sauce and greens. - Stone Grilled Beef Tongue ($14.80) - Very theatrical dish. The dish came with a decent amount of tongue. Personally, I would have preferred the wagyu beef over the beef tongue. Overall great value. - Saba Stick Sushi ($12.80) - One of the best mackerel sushi I have ever had. The cut was extremely thick, but not too overpowering. - Stone Bowl Seafood Sea Urchin Don ($16.80) - Great carb dish to top off your meal. The stone bowl don was loaded with bits of juicy shrimp, scallop and sea urchin. Best bang for your buck. Price: Overall, the dinner amounted to $100, not including tips. For presentation, service, and taste I would say it was extremely worth it. The servers spaced out all our dishes, so the service was pretty much omakase-style. If I am in Cabbagetown, I would stop by again to get the Saba Stick Sushi, Kingyo Bento and the Stone Bowl Seafood Sea Urchin Don.\",\n",

One with the cold items and one with the hot (fried stuff) - SO MUCH VARIETY... it came with SO MANY SAUCES too! I was surprised. Wish they were labelled so I would have known what they were. I don\\'t think the sauces were even mentioned in the item description. For example, it came with 4 sauces for the sushi... one of them was a ponzu JELLY, and there were at least 2 different kinds of soya sauce. One seemed less salty. The fried box had ketchup for the fries, hot sauce, a mayo that was more vinegary, and a more savory mayo with onion and garlic. I enjoyed them both! It was hard not to make big scoops of the mayo - all in all, everything was yummy and great a combo Trendy mazeramen: - Ive had soupless ramen many times from different places, including the OG that this ramen is trying to copy. It looks good and similar at the surface level, but thats about it. This was TOO dry... just because its soupless doesnt mean it has to be dry with no SAUCE. I think its lacking oil and also flavour - I ended up saving it for later so that I could add my own sauce and additional toppings for flavour (fried mushrooms, onions, hot sauce and sesame oil)',\n",

All their dishes are plated beautifully, and they exhibit the true Japanese-style presentation where each bento box is made up of dozens of high-quality, fresh ingredients and each mini item is crafted to perfection. They pay a lot of attention to detail in terms of presentation and variety in their dishes, especially the bento boxes. The bento boxes are closer to what you'd actually find in Japan (made up of lots of small portions of goodness, and everything is balanced so perfectly - the protein, carbs, veggies - lots of greens!).\",\n",

If you like game and other meats, but want relatively \"classic\" cooking, this is the place to go! I\\'ve only been here a couple times, but really enjoyed it! It\\'s also known to be a great place for a drink - the intimate and cozy setting is quiet and secluded and not too crowded. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointment and to make sure you have enough accommodation. All things aside, prices here are on the high side, so for me, going to Oxley is an absolute treat.

I don\\'t think everyone likes the food here, so be sure to check out the menu and research what\\'s available before you come.

However, the food, despite some efforts at upscale English pub food, falls apart a bit on the execution. The fish and chips plate looked great, but was seriously under-seasoned, and the batter was falling away from the fish. The fries were likewise under-seasoned, and also cut thick and under-fried, creating more of a baked potato effect. The tartar sauce, homemade and in an individual ramekin, was ice cold and rock-hard, likely spooned out in advance of service and left in the fridge. I cut it with a knife! The interior is great, all dark wood and antique furniture. The crowd is on the mature side and they appear to do a brisk after work business. A great pub for a drink and conversation, but the food falls short of its ambitions.\",\n",

              " \"4.5/5 In my ongoing pursuit of Toronto's best fish and chips, I've visited notable establishments like Fresco, Sea Witch, and Old Yorke. Unfortunately, most of them fell short of my expectations, except for Old Yorke. However, a new contender has emerged that might just surpass the reigning champion: Oxley. Upon entering Oxley, you'll be greeted by an ambiance that effortlessly combines the elegance of a British pub with a welcoming atmosphere. The expansive back patio invites patrons to relax and enjoy their meal in style. With a two-story layout, it creates a secluded garden-like space that feels like a hidden gem. Now, let's talk about the star of the show: the fish and chips. Oxley's choice of fish is the haddock.The delicate, golden batter encases the fish perfectly, providing a satisfying crunch. Unlike the heavy batter found at Sea Witch, each bite at Oxley strikes the right balance between fish and coating, ensuring a delightful texture and flavor combination. Accompanying the fish are a range of delightful flavors. A sprinkle of flaky salt enhances the natural taste of the fish, while a gentle squeeze of lemon adds a refreshing citrus kick. The tartar sauce, slightly thicker than usual, surprises with its light and tangy profile. And here's where Oxley takes an unexpected twist: their unique sauce, reminiscent of the iconic butter chicken, adds a captivating dimension to the dish. The fusion of vibrant tomatoes, warm spices, and succulent fish creates a harmonious and memorable flavor experience. Let's not forget about the fries, which offer a departure from the ordinary. These larger-cut delights boast a fluffy interior and a golden exterior, reminiscent of the chips found in authentic British establishments. Although they may lack the traditional crunch, their unique texture adds an interesting element to the overall enjoyment. While my search for Toronto's ultimate fish and chips continues, Oxley has undeniably made a lasting impression. If you're seeking a top-notch fish and chips experience in a welcoming setting, Oxley is an establishment that deserves your attention.\",\n",

So you have amazing bread and nice tomatoes with great presentation but no seasoning.  This may have been a kitchen mistake I have no idea but not to standard. The chicken liver pate was a bit funky. Something in the dish made it sour either the jam or something to do with the topping threw the dish off. Cheese dishes are a bit disappointing. For almost $50 you get 3 x 1oz slices of cheese and for the most part of the menu this was my least worth it though the cheeses are very good it a premium dish overall.

Ordered a fee apps, paella is still as good as I remembered it. The stand out tapas for me personally was the fig and machego combo. The flavors just worked really well. The cava prosecco was also ordered. It was ok.',\n",
              " \"3.75/5 Came here for my partner's birthday dinner on a Tuesday night with her brother. Great ambiance and our server was also great. Datiles $16 3/5 I thought this was quite unique so I decided to give it a try after reading the reviews. It came in 5  it was all too sweet for all 3 of us. I liked the profile of it if it wasn't as sweet as jam. Croquetas Setas $14 5/5 This came in 3 so the portion felt a bit small but it tasted fantastic. Very nicely cooked on the outside with a nice creamy, truffle flavor that tasted just right. Beef tartare $16 3.5/5 It looked promising but I found it way too vinegar-y. Seared foie gras $28 5+/5 This was amazing. It was the highlight of the night. The foie gras had an amazing texture that was just right, melted in your mouth, and tasted sublime. The combination of the walnuts and figs added a great texture and taste to the dish as well. Pulpo $23 3/5 This dish didn't make sense to me. The octopus was done well, but the combination with the potatoes just did not go very well. It was also quite bland. Roasted bone marrow $24 3.75/5 It was more of a beef cheek marmalade dish than it was a bone marrow dish. There was not a lot of bone marrow, and the lack of flavor by the bone marrow was compensated with the beef cheek marmalade. Paella patria $70 3/5 This was quite disappointing for a namesake paella (or 'homeland' paella). The seafood was cooked well but the rice just tasted like tomato rice with a tiny bit of salt. The seafood was tasty and on the saltier side so my partner was wondering if they made the rice less salty so you can eat it together. I do agree that the seafood and rice go well together if eaten together but there was too much rice for that. I'm not complaining that there wasn't enough seafood. The rice just lacked flavor. Churros $16 4.75/5 The churros was crispy yet fluffy and the sauce (dulce de leche and coffee chocolate) had the perfect amount of sweetness. I loved the bitterness of the chocolate as well. A bit pricey though. Tres leches $16 4.5/5 This felt sweet but it was quite perfect. It went down so smoothly. Good but also a bit pricey.\",\n",
              " '(3.5) Patria is a new age, cozy Spanish restaurant with a modern twist. Right in the middle of the Fashion/Entertainment district, it has the spark needed to thrive. We came in for the dinner service recently during the weekend. As we were seated, we were given the rundown on cocktails and how the menu is structured. As a predominantly Spanish tapas cuisine, there were many tapas options with entrée and paella options available. Along with a pitcher of sangria, we settled on Pimientos De Padron, Oveja Con Trufa La Quesera, the Beef Tartare, Whole Branzino and the Paella Patria. All in all, all the dishes came out on time and cooked well; nothing really to report on the peppers and the cheese. The beef tartare was fresh and well-seasoned, however there was quite a bit of water/liquid at the bottom of the plate. The dish was also served with some crackers, but there was no where close to being enough for the amount of crackers for the tartare; we used the sourdough that came with the cheese which actually was better suited for the dish in my opinion. The Branzino and Paella came out next - visually it was picturesque and the freshness of the ingredients was apparent. Both dishes were slightly under seasoned, but tasty nonetheless. The Paella looked and tasted great (other than being a bit under seasoned), I think they missed the mark when it came to Socarrat. Typically the tastiest and most fought after part of the dish, our Socarrat was nonexistent. Service was excellent and helpful, will likely return to try other dishes.',\n",
              " \"One of the few spots on King West I frequent, Patria does spanish food incredibly well. Their paella is great and they have a lot of other great classic dishes - especially their meats and cheeses. To be frank, I remember this spot being a bit better pre covid - it was an easy 5 stars for me then - and I still love Patria but it didn't quite blow me away as well as it did before. Here's the rundown of the food: - Croquetas: delicious mushroom croquetas with a truffle relish, I love the texture on these - Crudo: a classic with perfect balance of acidity - Pan Con Tomate: one of my favourites, so simple yet so elegant - Meatballs: these were much better when they were wagyu, but they're still pretty good now - Patatas Bravas: another one of our favourite dishes with lots of egg and a lightly crispy potato - Seafood Paella: loved the scallops especially but I do remember it being seasoned differently when I came here pre-Covid, still pretty good nonetheless Overall I'd say this is a delicious spot to try and I love the vibes here - especially the art with some wonderful paintings on the east side of the restaurant. It's on the pricey side, but worth experiencing at least once.\",\n",
              " \"Happy Saturday everyone! I visited patria last weekend and enjoyed some authentic paella and tapas. We got the following: - Paella Patria: argentinian gulf shrimp, pei mussels, fish, peas, clam, saffron - Croquetas de Setas: porcini mushrooms, manchego cheese, truffle aioli (not pictured because we gobbled it up ) - Gambas: argentinian gulf shrimp, garlic, parsley - Sorpresa Cava Sangria: white wine, raspberry peach liqueur, fresh lime, cranberry, rose cava, tart, citrus, light herbed essence The paella was cooked so perfectly, the shrimp were juicy and plump, along with the fresh seafood and saffron rice it all tied together so well! I just wish the flavour was a bit more bold, again this could just be a personal preference for me and my inner Indian craving spice lolol but definitely recommend it for anyone that likes their dishes on the milder side The croquetas were so yummy with the cheese and mushroom stuffing! We inhaled these so quickly and unfortunately didn't get a picture but we throughly enjoyed them The gambas were my favourite pick out of the tapas, you cannot go wrong with these !!!! They're HUGE, juicy and absolutely delicious Last but certainly NOT the least is the super tasty sopresa sangria, the combination of wine and raspberry peach liqueur worked so perfectly with the garnishes, I almost wish I ordered a jug all to myself lol but maybe next time! Overall we had an awesome experience dining at patria, our server was really nice and had great suggestions! The restaurant has beautiful decor inside with a very warm, cozy atmosphere bustling with people enjoying their meal and having a good time. Thank you for the tasty meal and amazing customer service patria, see you soon! If you're ever downtown or simply looking to have some yummy Spanish tapas do check them out y'all :)\",\n",
              " \"First time visitor from California! Wanted to try a different cuisine than what I normally lean towards. The ambiance is great and service was also good (not overly spectacular but nothing to complain about either). We were hungry after an event and ordered several items to try. 1. Bone marrow app: came out suspiciously fast but didn't mind one bit (at first). The beef cheek shredding on top seemed like a good twist but honestly, it was only OK, slightly dry, and lukewarm. Didn't feel like it added much. It also came with 3 previously toasted slices of bread that were also lukewarm and very thin and stale tasting. Wished we had better toast & more of it to enjoy the marrow. 2. Chicken liver pate app: It had a fruit (?) jelly layer that was set on top. While this is a good idea to cut the richness of the pate, this jelly tasted horrible. It was like cherry cough medicine. Otherwise, the pate itself was good (not amazing). But it was still served with the stale toast. 3. Veggie paella: menu said it would take 45 mins but it was more like 15 mins so that was good! It was fine but again, not amazing. 4. Lamb chops: we ordered the half rack. The waiter said chefs recommended this dish cooked medium well and I had never heard of such a recommendation. It's nearly always medium rare or medium in my experience. This dish didn't taste bad in any way but the flavors were all wrong and I did not enjoy it one bit. WAYY too much going on. The chops had a sherry cumin rub on the outside and sat on top of a pepper sauce. They were then smothered in a chimichurri sauce and lastly coated with loads of sesame seeds. I could barely taste the flavor of the lamb. Also, the menu said they are coated in hazelnut but I guess they only had sesame seeds. I don't prefer sesame seeds and wished the waiter could have at least told us. Overall, I wouldn't come back and can't recommend this place.\",\n",
              " \"We tried the Paella Patria, Paella de la Huerta, mushroom croquettes, and three different types of cheeses (Iberico la Quesera, Oveja con Trufa la Quesera, and 12 Month D.O. Manchego). While all of the food was delicious and reminiscent of authentic Spanish tapas, my favourite dishes were the Paella de la Huerta (vegetarian) and the mushroom croquettes. I also loved the Oveja con Trufa la Quesera (truffle, sheep's milk cheese). If you plan to order paellas, set aside at least 45 minutes to wait for it to cook. Also, the portion sizes are smaller than expected so be prepared to order a few dishes!\",\n",

I got the red Lotus, which was a suggestion from our waiter, who said it was his favorite cocktail it's definitely mine too. I loved that this cocktail was refreshing but also sweet. It kinda reminded me of those Asian jelly cups that I had as a kid. As for the food, we got the Saigon wings which were grilled but they were super crispy and juicy. I love the kick of flavor it had. We also got these deep fried shrimp balls that were also very delicious and I like the sauce it came with. We also got a pork belly dish to share.

The noodle dish on its own also had flavour so you can enjoy the noodles both with/ without dipping the noodles . The beef basically tasted like the same in the vermicelli bowl ! The decor is simply magical ! Love the lantern /Asia feel to the restaurant . Some not so positive points- the seats are so uncomfortable. Very hard and hurts the bum:( Table size is also very small and the chairs have no place to hang your purse or put it behind since it is not a full back chair. Unfortunately it was raining that day and we forced to either put our purse on our laps or ground. I tried my friend's chicken in the vermicelli and it was really dry . Also tried the Bo lot at Viet festival last year at Dundas Square and it was just regular ie would not get it again\",\n",

The lemongrass beef with rice was yummy too. Service was also quick and attentive.',\n",

My pork belly entree also came out like 15 minutes later than my partner\\'s meal. Not a huge deal but kind of unusual. They were apologetic about it. My Lantern Dragon cocktail was a but sweet for my taste. I know that\\'s a risk you run with dragon fruit but I couldn\\'t taste any lemongrass at all which is why I ordered the drink. Old Hanoi was \"good as hell.\" The spring rolls held up to the hype -- they were really good and a generous portion. Crispy and very flavorful. 5/5. I wanted to like the coconut clams, and enjoyed the flavor, but it was *super weird* that the dish was basically served at room temperature. I can\\'t imagine that\\'s intentional? Not when it\\'s served in a crock. The pork belly clay pot was bomb. Incredibly tender pork belly - and a lot of it - with the marinated egg, nice pickled veggies to brighten it up, served with rice. Mm! I would happily order that again. Probably regret getting anything else. We were looking forward to the egg salted snails dish but they were out, unfortunately.

The ambience in the restaurant is lovely, with a plethora of frames adorning the walls, unique light fixtures, and elegant furnishings. We ordered the spaghetti alla carbonara and pesce spada (swordfish). The carbonara was tossed in a parmesan wheel right in the center of the restaurant, and tasted pretty good. I was less impressed with the fish, which leaned on the bland side. The gnocchi was the better part of the dish, rather than the protein centerpiece. We got a peach dessert that was on the menu in honour of TIFF, and because it was my partner's birthday, they also brought us a complimentary slice of cassata (ice cream cake with pistachio, rosemary, and rhubarb). Both desserts were delicious. Service here did not disappoint - we really felt well taken care of throughout our meal.

Been wanting to go for a while and I did not regret it when I finally got the chance. They have a wide range of both mocktails and cocktails. If the ones we tried they were all fantastic and fun. Whatever your fancy there is something for everyone. The appetizers were amazing too. House baked breads and calamari. Though I'm not the biggest fan of calamari this has to have been one of the best experiences I've ever had. Tender, salty, and flavourful. Great way to start the meal. The steak was similarly succulent and beautifully plated. Since, we were here and surrounded by cheese wheels we also had to try some pasta. Though the cacio e pepe looked amazing and was being prepared table side the carbonara was calling me. It was so rich and creamy. All the dishes really left me fulfilled but still wanting more. For dessert there we got tiramisu and rum cake. I probably would have passed on the cake had it not been on the prix fixe menu. However, given they have other new seasonal options I might have gone for something else like a yuzu sorbet had it been on the menu then. Overall, Toca is just an amazing dining experience from the elegant restaurant, to the fantastic and friendly service, and the mouth watering food. I'd highly recommend everyone go at least once. I'm personally checking my day planner for when I will have an opportunity to drop by again. One small criticism is their chair leather is falling apart.

If I'm gonna spend that kind of money I would expect the food/service to be a lot better. The pricing on the menus have gone up significantly from the ones that are posted here on the Yelp profile.\",\n",

Service is seamless and ensures a comfortable meal. We took the opportunity during a recent celebration to come for a meal. Do not be fooled by the simple white nondescript entrance, as the restaurant is expansive inside with a dark cozy atmosphere. Think dark woods and dim lighting. We had the croquettes, french onion soup, the porterhouse steak, and strawberry cheesecake to finish. Everything from start to finish was perfectly executed. The porterhouse steak was of course the standout, as every bite was medium rare and delicious. A wonderful place to have a memorable meal!\",\n",
              " \"It's been a long time since we went to a steakhouse.  I wanted to have a traditional experience and we certainly got that, very tight, and crowded on a Saturday night.  Lighting was dark as expected, maybe a bit too dark.  We shared a 24oz rib steak with some side dishes.  Steak was cooked to perfection, perfectly juicy, enjoyed the cut.  Seasoning was mild with the Barberian's steak seasoning.  Service was good without being amazing given how tight it was in there with tables fairly close together.  The sides were garlic bread (amazing!), fries, button mushrooms, and their traditional pickled vegetables (also amazing! and provided to every table - nice touch).  We would go back but in a larger group, clientele were mostly regulars, there were certainly no Instagram influencers here and that was refreshing for a change.\",\n",
              " \"One of the more disappointing meals I've had in Toronto.  Fortunately the steak, a ribeye, was good and cooked to the right temperature.  It was a little thin for my liking but a good steak, no complaints.  I also liked the Brussels sprouts, cooked with vinegar, never had Brussels sprouts like them but in a good way.  The real disappointment was the heirloom tomato salad. I love tomatoes and it sounded great (heirloom tomatoes with horseradish) but was close to inedible.  The tomatoes had little flavour and were very mushy.  Given this is the height of tomato season, they should have been great, these were the opposite.  Heirloom or not, these are possibly the worst tomatoes I've ever had.  Also had the grilled bacon and grilled salami, both were disappointing.  The bacon was okay but not great (steakhouse bacon is usually on another level) and the salami was actually pretty bland.\",\n",
              " \"Very good steakhouse.  Typical old school steakhouse ambience and service.  Started with six very nice oysters.  For a main, had the bone in large rib eye.  By US standards, not too large, but it was cooked perfectly and had a nice flavor.  I found the wine list light on reasonably priced options, though we did have a very nice Frank Family Zinfindal.  My only disappointment was a side order of sautéed onions, which weren't very good.  They were not caramelized and not even cut well, had big half circle sections.  The steak, though, made it an excellent evening.\",\n",

We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for a table since we didn't get a chance to make a reservation, which was a mistake. Make sure to have a reservation if you plan on dining here. This place was packed, probably because of how good the food is! The restaurant looks quite eccentric, with lots of colours and tropical decor. Makes you feel like you are eating in Thailand! It is on the smaller side, however, so you'll be very close to your neighbouring tables. We ended up sitting on the outside patio since there was no space inside. We ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and the Khao Pad (Pineapple Fried Rice with Chicken). The Chicken Pad Thai was probably the best Pad Thai that I've had for sure. It was super flavourful, and the side of peanuts is such a great addition to a Pad Thai. The only thing was that there was a too many bean sprouts (I usually prefer more noodles over bean sprouts). The coconut sticky rice that comes with the fried rice was SO GOOD. The chicken was super spicy (probably should have ordered mild), but the coconut rice does a good job of cooling your mouth down.\",\n",
              " 'What is the big deal? I have had better. The service was ok nothing worth Michelin rated. Each dish was just basic and no real substance. The drink was only best thing I had. Save yourself there are better places in Toronto.',\n",
              " \"We felt like Thai for dinner and decided to visit this neighborhood joint, and we're far from disappointed! The place had an amazing Thai vibe, two floors and a patio that was jam packed with patrons. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, but there were so many places just outside to look at. We started with the coconut soup, with chicken. The aroma with such a milk infusion of lemon grass, citrus and coconut hits your face as the waiter places in front of you, and I have to admit that's when I started heavily salivating. The soup was loaded with fresh chicken slices, and topped with coriander, great combination, and a little on the spicy side, just how we like it. I had the Thai ice tea, and it really does taste like what they make in Thailand, there was a delicate balance of herbs, a robust tea taste, and the sweet creaminess of the condensed milk, wow, perfection! I would highly recommend this if your into Thai ice tea. In fact I would probably go back just to have this with their mango sticky rice (which I've had at a previous dinner here). Our appetizer came, warm, crispy, and loaded with filling. The tofu roll had a good amount of shrimp, and other items, this was also spicy, but it came with a sweet cause to dip into, which was a good complimentary flavour for the rolls and balanced the spice in them. The last item we ordered was the pineapple chicken curry, which I think was ok. I know this is one of those dishes that people rave about, but I honestly didn't understand the hype here. Thought I've been here several Times previously, and thoroughly enjoyed my meals, this is the one time I wished I had ordered something else. The pineapple chunks were not sweet, they were kind of salty, and the curry wasn't very balanced in their spice profile. I was quite surprised, as this restaurant has always previously been 100% impressive for all of our dishes. However, the coconut rice was exactly as I remember, super fresh, and absolutely delicious! The service from start to finish was great, staff were knowledgeable, and when you asked for opinions of food choices, they didn't recommend the most expensive menu item, but did just speak to us about the entire list of appetizers (I wish they narrowed it down for us though). We can't wait to be back!\",\n",
              " \"We had some take out from this place and my goodness were our tastebuds delighted! We tried mostly their vegetarian fare, which I was just so surprised as how good it was. The pad Thai I would go there just for this alone! The tofu was well marinated, and the flavours of the pad Thai were just so well infused with great spices and sauces, such a well made meal! The veggie mix was also well infused with flavour, and the tofu was nicely marinated before it was thrown into this dish. I can't really tell what the flavours were, but they all just worked well together. I can understand why more people are converting to being vegetarian, when food is so well made, I can't wait to go back here to try out the rest of this menu!\",\n",

Lucky we only had to wait around 10 min for our table to be ready. Coming in this place an beautiful decor, like being transported to Thailand. It was dark on the patio (as it was a winter evening) with ambiance lighting but the inside was bright and vibrant. The food we ordered came out very fast (not sure if they're always like this or they prioritized us because we had to leave promptly. The pad see ew was very good with nice soy sauce flavour among other spices with a decent amount of vege and chicken.  But the pad Thai was the show stopper for me. It was AMAZING. It was sweet and savoury with decent sized shrimp and the noodles were cooked perfectly with a nice chew to the rice noodle. I'll be coming back over and over again!\",\n",

I ordered a medium spice but I couldn't taste it very much. They do warn you that the next level up may be a little spicy. The flavor in the broth was good. Seats were comfortable.\",\n",

And the end we were very happy with all of our choices. The cowboy was absolutely phenomenal, and the fried rice tasted delicious. The drink was also super refreshing. The ambiance here is casual and party like, as if on vacation in Thailand. I'm really glad we came here!\",\n",
              " \"I read an article about how great this restaurant is, so I bookmarked it for a future visit. A few years forward and my friend said she was craving Thai food. So I made a reservation for Saturday dinner. The restaurant was small and fun! There were decorations all around. My boyfriend and I arrived before my friend did, so we checked-in at our reservation time and requested to be seated at the patio. The staff were friendly and helpful- they suggested a few popular items off the menu and kindly reminded us about the time limit for dining. While waiting, we ordered two drinks, Jas-mi-peach and Thai green tea. Both drinks were lightly sweet and refreshing! When my friend arrived, we ordered our mains: My boyfriend ordered Tom Yum with chicken and two Mii Pu (for takeout). My friend ordered Khao Soi with braised beef and I ordered the same one with veggies and tofu. The portion size was very generous- it could be shared between two people! Khao Soi was delicious, the noodles were lightly chewy, the broth was a bit spicy, the veggies and tofu pieces were well-cooked. My friend and boyfriend said they also enjoyed their meal. Due to the time limit to dine, we weren't able to enjoy eating and talking as much. Despite that, we had a good time. A few tips: - Make a reservation early! Time slots fill out fast. -There is a time limit for dining (90 minutes), so read the menu and decide beforehand - The seating (outside and inside) are very tight- bring the least amount of belongings. If you're looking for an adventure for your tastebuds, this is a great spot!\",\n",

The basil chicken is my gogo dish at Thai restaurants that I sue to test them out and they have nailed it here,  really delsicous dish,  wonderful flavours and balance.

The Pad Thai comes wrapped in an egg pancake, and the serving is HUGE. Noodles were slightly undercooked but I like them Al dente, so it was cheesy. The tamarind is clearly made in house and the chicken large chunks of white meat chicken. The presentation is awesome. Server was very friendly and attentive. Prices totally fair.

It was lightly spicy- the noodles were cooked to perfection, the vegetables were cooked well, and the roasted peanuts provided crunchiness to the meal.

I've never had haggis before but had a preconception that it was pretty awful but this haggis changed my mind. Scotland's national dish of lamb, oats and spices on a bed of mashed turnip and potatoes. It was well seasoned and tasted delicious! The texture was of ground meat. Nothing binding it together, I don't think. Knife not required. The crisps on the top were welcomed to contrast the texture of the smooth mash. They do have vegetarian options here too. The tasting itself was wonderful. A representative from Tomintoul presented to us their 4 whiskies: 10, 12, 16 and peated. He went through a brief history and process of making the whiskey in which we ended each segment with a nosing and tasting of each whiskey starting with the 10 year.

What a let down... .but that just went to prove how popular the dish is.. We decided to dine at the restaurant anyways and were seated by a pleasant host in the back, cozy patio. I asked for the Scotch egg appetizer right away since I remembered it being delicious.. It was tastier than before and the little salad that came on the same plate had a very nice, slightly sweet dressing on it.. As for my entree, I couldn't decide if I should go for the butter chicken because it is usually too sweet and creamy in the Indian restaurants I have had it at. Anyway, I thought I would try it and ...it has my vote for the best butter chicken in town!!  Chicken thighs were used, perhaps, but at least it was not breast meat which is served in most Indian restaurants. And it was the right spicyness ..

Turns out there's another section at the back that opens up to a lovely patio. The customers out back seemed to be enjoying themselves and I retracted my first impression.

I've only had a Scotch egg one other time at a carnival so I wasn't sure what to expect. The Scotch egg was delicious! It wasn't too salty and paired nicely with the salad. I'm not much of a salad eater. My fish and chips was decent. I have fond memories of fish and chips in the UK and this wasn't quite the same. The steak in my friend's steak pie was so flavourful and tender. A lot of the time I've had dry and not tasty meat in pies such as this.

There were mushed cherries at the bottom of my backpack, it was quite gross. The waitress saw the displeasure on my face and when I asked for a couple of napkins she offered to wet a couple for me. What service! She even got me a ziplock bag so that my cherries would not create more of a mess for me. The service was impeccable and sitting at the back enjoying the atmosphere was lovely. I'm sure I'll be back to try something else on the menu.\",\n",

              " \"What an incredible dining experience! Food: Venison Tartare- This was such a delicate dish; Savory but fresh at the same time. I actually was not a fan of the rye cracker; it was far too hard. 5/5 Mushroom Caserecce- What a heavenly dish! The flavor profile was more towards the truffle rather than the bolognese, but absolutely decadent. I could eat this everyday!!! 5/5 BC Chinook Salmon- This was a smaller cut of salmon but absolutely to die for. Every element of this dish worked in the most harmonious way. 5/5 Smoked Chocolate Mousse- This was a delicious desert for the first 2 bites, but was a bit too powerful and somewhat bitter for me. The smokiness definitely comes through and is potent. 3/5 Ontario Butternut squash cheesecake- This was an interesting flavor profile; one that I have not had experienced before. Surprisingly delicious and mild in flavor. 4.5/5 Drinks: Earl of Montenegro: Somewhat bland and disappointing actually 3/5 Barrel aged black manhattan- A very good manhattan; I really enjoyed the tobacco bitters 5/5 Duck a L'Orange- This was a good drink, nothing to rave about. 4/5 Service: We sat at the bar- Service was fantastic. Food came out promptly and I was not left without a drink for more than a few minutes. Everyone was very friendly and courteous. 5/5 Ambience: Very relaxed environment, with smaller and bigger groups. It's a small venue but they definitely make it work. It got a little loud at times, but that just depends on the tables and the clientele at any given point in time. 5/5\",\n",
              " \"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The venue is well decorated but pretty tiny so recommend making a reservation online as it could fill up rather quickly. This place specializes in game meats and I was initially teetering between the bison ribeye or the wild boar steak and was wondering which one would be more gamey. The waitress was very helpful in my decision and I'm happy to report that I didn't taste any gamey-ness at all in the ribeye. Everything in that dish melded together very well. From the tenderness of the bison ribeye to the flavorful polenta and plentiful kale/rapini mixture, I found myself wanting more and more after each bite. It was just done, really really well. My partner had the confit duck leg and that was a treat as well. The duck was also very flavorful and tasty. The only thing that threw us off was there was hint of horseradish in the butternut squash puree that kind of ruined the flavor of the risotto for us. We would get flavors of good and savory and then random bouts of horseradish that just did not mesh well. Aside from the mains, I also got the duck heart yakitori appetizer and that was unfortunately a miss for me. That was the only thing that lacked flavor for me. Could have used some salt? Other than that, can definitely attest that it was worth the money and would come back.\",\n",

We started off with the house cured meats and cheese board. The house cured meats were some of the best I've ever had. The star of the meal was definitely the ribeye steak. Will definitely go back next time we are in town.\",\n",

Sending a bill to Doug Ford for an open keg which they can't use due to flip flopping of covid rules, the chef cooking meat in front of vegan protesters... They have character. 3 of us came here for dinner on a Tuesday, we luckily had reservations as the place was full. Ambiance (4 stars) We were seated outside, the back patio is 4 tables with wooden fencing around it. Nothing pretty but comfortable. Inside it was also on the smaller side, cozy. Service: (5 stars) Good service, working with you to find cocktails you like. Drinks: Duck a L'orange (5 stars): the best cocktail I tried here. Very smooth with an undertone of vanilla. Made with duck fat. We tried smoked barrel (4 stars) and lady marmalade(3 stars) as well. They were good, but cannot compare to Duck a L'orange. Food: ANTLER TRUFFLE BRIE - (4 stars) It was good, but nothing amazing DUCK HEART YAKITORI (4 stars) - the duck hearts were just ok, but the sauce and the scallions were outstanding. BISON RIB EYE (4.5 stars) - very well cooked, the mushrooms were amazing. ONTARIO VENISON LOIN (4 stars) - a bit salty, but otherwise very pleasant. Deserts: MAPLE TART (4 stars) - would order it again STRAWBERRY SEMIFREDDO (3 stars) - almost a pallet cleanser. SMOKED CHOCOLATE MOUSSE (5 stars) - comes with a smoke bowl on top, a heavy desert, great for sharing.  Desert comes with a presentation. Next time I would go for Duck a L'orange drink and the burger.\",\n",

Although they recommend medium rare ; I'd advise getting medium for the bison steak . I had a hard time cutting the steak at medium rare. Also if you get the bison steak make sure you're hungry ; it's really filling (not complaining about that ; happy to be full :) ) Also friendly and accommodating staff ; I asked for them to cook my steak further ; not only did they do that but they also gave me an extra serving of mushrooms ! Awesome job on their part :) .\",\n",

The foods and drink were awesome. I particularly loved the Venison loin. It was tender, cooked to perfection, and the entire dish was beautiful and delicious. I loved that the greens weren't overcooked. The smoked chocolate mouse for dessert was also a star. Go to Antler Kitchen & Bar!\",\n",

We had tartare, smoked cabbage salad, bison ribeye, and a fish dish with lentils (forgetting which fish off the top of my head.) Everything was great. The bison ribeye was worth all $58 and then some. I'll be looking forward to getting that again for next time. They were even so sweet about my rapini intolerance (rip, I will miss you sweet delicious rapini.) AND THE FEATURE DESSERT!!! It was clementine cheesecake. It was light delicious, and fresh. It tasted like pure clementine, we even watched another table taste it to see how they'd react, and they were also delighted. Excited to come back, the wine was great and so were the cocktails. This place rules!!!\",\n",

We got their Duck Heart Yakitori (3.5/5) & Wild Mushroom Tart (4.5/5) to start. The duck heart wasn't as liver-like as I thought and the texture was interesting, overall was a wild-card try for us!

I highly recommend doing reservations a week or at least a few days in advance if you're planning to do a weekend night. Pizza Oro: Good portions of toppings and the pizza sauce were delicious. The pizza was thin but wasn't too soggy with the toppings. Rigatoni al Funghi: The sauce was good, lots of flavour with the white truffle sauce. Great option if you're already a fan of rigatoni. Calamari Fritti: Different breading they use for the calamari, which was still crispy yet light which is a nice change from other places. The portions were decent to share with a group of friends. The service was good despite being a busy weekend night. Only downside that the seating is a bit tight that you might likely end up being near the door, but besides that, it's totally worth coming.

I came on a weekend night so it was pretty busy, highly recommend getting a reservation beforehand. Since I came with no reservation, I ended up eating at the bar side which was still okay but definitely more ideal to book reservations in advance if you're coming with a group. Tonnarelli: Deliciously creamy and was the perfect amount of flavour. The flavour was quite rich that other additional toppings weren't needed. Pappardelle: Great pasta noodles and nice tomato sauce. It was quite delicious and loved how much flavour there was. It's a great spot for delicious pasta at a reasonable price point. I really liked how both kinds of pastas weren't overwhelming and still filled with flavour. The place is a bit on the small side and tight on seating so reservations are necessary, I got lucky that there were some spots to still sit at the bar seats.

Arancini we're not warm all the way through, cold in the centre - never experienced something like this at any other restaurant I've been to. The sauce with Arancini is good, but come on... Food needs to be cooked (or at least microwaved) properly. We got the prosciutto pizza and didn't expect to get a soggy piece of dough with cold toppings on top - very strange that the dough is warm and everything else on the pizza is cold like it came from a fridge. The waitress was quiet and awkward. Place looks simple and nice, but it didn't live up to all of its reviews with the cold food. Won't be back.\",\n",

My favourite was the pasta with the rose sauce and large juicy shrimps, which I wish there was more of. The pizza, while not soggy was a bit tough but enjoyable nonetheless. The staff were super friendly and made sure to explain everything as we ordered and got the food. We got a gelato at the end which was a nice ending to a wonderful meal.',\n",

The seating area of the restaurant was rather limited but had a good view of the open kitchen. Food came fast, service was okay. Barbabitole - Was heavy, but delicious. There was a generous amount of buffalo ricotta which was super fatty and rich. Candied beats and vincotta was delicious as it offset the ricotta fattiness. Pistachio was a good touch as it added a crunch to the cheese and cooked beats. Delicious, would recommend! Pizza Oro - A thin crust pizza with a lot of toppings: 3 different sausages, garlic, basil, cheese. The contents of the pizza was only okay, if felt like too many things happening at once. Or the sausages don't have much flavor or the ingredients was not spread out well. The dough was a bit disappointing. The crust was too dry and burnt for my taste. The bottom of the pizza was cooked, but I would have expected a bit more toasted. Based on this pizza experience, I'd order a pasta next time.\",\n",

As usual, I looked for places with great ambiance and delicious food right here on Yelp, and wow - tons of great reviews for this place! I tried to secure a reservation, but none were to be had online, so we ventured out and tried our luck! Fortunately, they were able to accommodate us and we settled right in, thanks to Bia, our friendly Brazilian server for the evening - she was FANTASTIC, and ensured that we would have a fun, delicious meal as a family. Draught Moretti and Peroni are tasty, and served on their respective glassware. Calamari fritti were light and delicious, served with a tangy and delicious aioli. The gamberetti a la griglia with diavolo sauce were AWESOME! I could have eaten 3 plates of those, actually. We then shared the Prosciutto di Parma and Burrata pizza - it was real Burrata and Prosciutto di Parma, not Mozzarella and ordinary smoked ham - absolutely perfect char on their tasty, slightly chewy dough and their delightfully bright red tomato / basil sauce We also had their pappardelle with ossobucco ragú - pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the sauce... the sauce was every bit as luxurious and tasty as it sounds. The gelato is to DIE for - especially the chocolate / hazelnut masterpiece... do it! We finished the evening with gelatos and delicious Italian coffee drinks - Macchiato, Cortado, and Cappuccino. I LOVED this place and highly recommend it to you - I WILL be back next time I'm in Toronto! Grazie!!!!\",\n",

Toppings were generous, crust was buttered goodness. - Pappardelle Osso Buccu: Tender braised veal, perfectly al dente pasta, generous serving. Loved it. - Cozze: Ok sized mussels (and lots of them), really tasty tomato sauce. Service was super friendly and spot-on with suggestions. Price is fair. It's in an old building so a bit warm in the summer. Overall, a great Italian treat in the area.\",\n",

The pizza had a good char on the bottom from being fired in the wood oven I presume, it was thin but had ample toppings. The pasta was the favourite! The pasta was perfectly al dente, it had such a rich and deep mushroom flavour, all the while not being too heavy with the cream.

We didn't have a reservation, so we waited in line and the friendly staff at the front took down one of our names. Then we were informed that it would be about 30 minute wait and were asked to wait until our name was called. While waiting, we looked around- the vibe was energetic and fun, the customers were eating and laughing. The decor was cool- the lights were dimmed, there were various colourful objects all around to evoke a comfy feel. I thought the place was pretty small, until our name was called and we were led to a table by a friendly young lady. The place was huge- there were multiple sections and each section had its own decor! Our seat was at the end section, where the decor reminded us of sitting inside someone's home. Our server was a second friendly young lady. She warmly greeted us and showed us the menu (QR code). She said she'll be back to take our order in a few minutes. To start, we ordered Shrimp Chips and two Thai Ice Tea. For the main, I picked Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken. My friend chose Khao Soi with beef. A few minutes later, the Shrimp Chips and two Thai Ice Tea came to us. The Shrimp Chips were delicious- they were crispy and lightly salty. The Thai Ice Tea was tasty- it tasted like milk tea with deeper tea flavour. Then our mains came and we couldn't wait to eat! For my meal, the blend of veggies, chewy noodles, and the chicken pieces were delicious- however it was a bit salty. My friend enjoyed her meal as well- she said that she liked the smooth coconut curry with blend of spices and the juicy pieces of beef. Throughout our meal, our server came by to check-in on us to make sure that we had everything we needed. The portions were generous and the dishes and drinks were delicious!

So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in 30 mins. Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy. We are group of 5. Ordered Food: # THAI CHICKEN WINGS # GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters ) # MOO PING (grilled pork skewers) # GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken) # GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef) # PAD SEE EW (Shrimp) Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli). The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick. The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as \"wow\". Drinks (Cocktails) # GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.) # THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower) # RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime) All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick. The amount of food were perfect for 5 adults. Will come back!!!!!',\n",

Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy! Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick. I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too!

It is a must get, in my book. Hubby and I decided to go vegetarian for our entrees. Hubby ordered Tofu Pad Gra Prow which was very good while I ordered Tofu Khao Soi. There was a perfect balance between the curry and soup. The harmonious coconut milk with the stock made it the standout dish with its refreshing combination of flavors and textures. I truly appreciate the notion that they offer plenty of vegetarian food and can make any dish vegan. This is a trendy place and you should make reservations on Friday nights as well as the weekends.

From the the duck confit app, gem salad, mushroom app, and spiced sticky toffee pudding was praised by the British guest who enjoyed this version of their national dessert. They had sufficient staff checking on us throughout the evening that were always friendly. The time we did need them to take our food / drink order we did have to wait (awkward). Overall we had a very pleasant dinner catch up there.',\n",

The restaurant has a minimalistic interior with blonde wood and curved limestone walls, creating a warm and intimate atmosphere. The menu focuses on Northern Italian cuisine and delicate coastal, Mediterranean flavor. The standout dishes include the stracchino-stuffed Ligurian flatbread and the squid ink spaghetti paired with Nova Scotia lobster. p.s. they have been awarded a michelin star. Have a read of their review on the michelin site, if you are curious to learn more.',\n",

This place is so great for a special occasion  - the interior feels clean and warm, and the service is fantastic! They are extremely attentive and were constantly filling out water which is a plus in my book. The food was tasty with well balanced flavors, but I felt it was overpriced...I personally feel that Italian food can only taste so good without going overboard. I would definitely recommend the veal carpaccio and ravioli doppi - very well balanced in both flavor and texture\",\n",
              " \"While Osteria Giulia has been awarded a Michelin star, it's unlikely they'll receive a service award anytime soon. Having arrived five minutes early, they weren't ready to seat tables and we were asked to leave - no option to wait inside or at the bar, what a pain during a windy cold fall evening. Nonetheless, once we were seated, our waitress was warm and welcoming, making up for the poor first impression from the hostess. Luckily, the food didn't disappoint. The burrata e caviale ($45), although served a bit cold for my taste, was soft and fluffy, the centre creamy but doesn't ooze out upon being cut through. The simple starter was a cacophony of flavours mixing briny Italian caviar, sweet Asfodelo honey, and a smoky sourness from the Blackbird bread. That splash of sweetness from the honey was unexpected but absolutely made the dish. Pull apart the calamari ripieni con tonno ($36) before taking a bite and you'll find the delicate seafood stuffed with yellowfin tuna paste so there's a meatiness to each bite. It's topped with a puntarella and charred pepper salad, giving the calamari a refreshing crispy bite. I'm glad it wasn't overloaded with too many sauces so that the natural seafood flavours were present. In retrospect, the lorighittas al mare ($38) was too similar to the calamari. In fact, when the dish was presented, all I could see was a plate of squid rings, only to find many were circles of hand braided pasta. Our waitress explains what makes the dish special is the time intensive nature of creating the pasta, which did have a lovely bite to it. Everything is tossed in a tasty olive oil sauce with a hint of garlic, chilli, and an umami essence from anchovy. I just wish the dish had more of the bay scallops and even some spot prawns thrown in to make it taste more like a seafood pasta. I'm generally hesitant to order ravioli as it's usually a scant dish and when they are not adequately filled it can taste like you're eating pieces of dough. Osteria Giulia's ravioli doppi ($44) smartly has one side unsealed so they can be overstuffed with silky ricotta and sauce, so you get a gush of filling with each bite. Chunks of lobster and kernels of sweet corn add richness and texture to the dish. It was an impressive dish and the most memorable of the evening. This is a long review head to Gastro World for the rest.\",\n",
              " \"After having bookmarked this 1-star Michelin restaurant for far too long, I finally decided to try it. The two of us ordered a wide assortment of dishes, so much so that the regular who sat next to us applauded us for our courageous and seemingly bottomless appetites. Cavoletti - Brussels sprouts, smoked sardines, anchovy butter, pistachios. It was a unique pairing of textures and flavors. Interesting. I could appreciate the creativity behind the recipe. Polpo alla Griglia - Grilled octopus, smoked potato, soleggiati tomatoes, seaweed butter. While the octopus was tender and the dish was visually appealing, I found the blended flavors to be odd-tasting. Carre di Agnello - 8pc lamb rack, we asked for medium-rare. Came out more on the rare side and the meat was a little chewy. It was also lacking in flavour, carried only by the infused olive oil - the lamb could've used a lot more seasoning and char. Lorighittas al Mare - Hand-braided pasta, wild squid, bay scallops, chili, garlic, anchovy. Flavour was good and pasta was al dente. Unfortunate that the portions were rather small for $38. Spaghettoni ai Ricci Di Mare - Spaghetti, BC sea urchin, soleggiati tomatoes, pangrattato. I was most looking forward to this dish and most disappointed by it. Only 1-2 pieces of uni atop an otherwise uninspiring base. Though orange in color, the sauce did not taste of uni and instead, was completely overwhelmed by cheesiness. I got sick of its single-tone flavour and heaviness by my last bite. Overall, did I appreciate the dining experience and culinary innovation? For the most part, yes. Would I say there were any dishes that were memorable and that I would crave again? Unfortunately, no.\",\n",
              " \"Upscale Italian fare with impeccable service, food and ambiance. Came here for a special occasion on a Monday with resos. 5pm. It was bumpin'. Full house. Space is loud so be ready to talk over other tables. Food: Focaccia di recco - flatbread stuffed with cheese and sea salt.  Probably one of my favorite dishes. Can't go wrong with cheese and bread. Vitello tonnato - veal carpaccio with crème fresh and capers. Meaty, creamy, delicious. Spaghetti ai Ricci di mare - sea urchin (uni) pasta - what a delight. Rich and creamy uni in a carbonara type sauce. The level of concentrated flavor in this dish is unmatched. Frutti di mare alla griglia - grilled seafood platter for two. Octopus, monk fish, White Sea bass, jumbo prawn, tiger prawn, scallops. Great for sharing or even eat it yourself if you want to indulge. Excellent variety as each one was cooked differently from the other. The monk fish skin was a little tough though. Not a meal I can eat daily otherwise I would die from the richness of the dishes Overall good experience. Would come again. No parking, look for street parking on Bernard street or Davenport. 4.5/5\",\n",

I was excited to try this restaurant; they received a one Michelin star,and they're known for their seafood dishes. It is a must to get their focaccia bread! It's completely different than a normal focaccia bread we're familiar with. It's basically a flat bread with melted cheese and it was delicious. Their branzino was the best dish of the night as well as their clam pasta. The seafood is all cooked to perfection. The service was good, and the ambiance of the place was modern and clean. Their calamari pasta was unique because the pasta is braided; however, I prefer the clam pasta. Next time, I would try their seafood platter. I heard the platter is amazing!

We called ahead and left a voice message as our crew decided to head over after work on Friday night for a happy hour/small plate dinner. Upon arrival, we were informed that they do not take reservations over the phone and that we would have had to make them via Open Table. When I looked at the restaurant's website, the reservations tab did not indicate that reservations were only taken through Open Table. In fact, I could not find the link for Open Table on the web page. We were seated upstairs at the bar and the bar tender was out of this world great. I ordered the Mediterrean Mule without the honey. He was very accommodating and after I disclosed my food allergies, he would not let me dig into my plat of maple roasted beets until he verified that the glaze had no honey in it. After the initial snafu at the door, the experience was great, the company was outstanding, and the food was great.

For the price point, food items were small and all came out cold in temperature. The dip with the bread was alright but they could have given more bread since we had lots of dip leftover to use with other food. The beef dishes were a disappointment.

In this case, my phone did not eat first. The aroma of the freshly cut herbs, Parmesan cheese, and homemade marinara sauce were an absolute seller. For my main course, I ordered the Calamrai aka Griglia. This was the dish that sold my experience. The Mediterranean seasoning had the perfect amount of salt that coupled well with the squid.

              " 'Decided to splurge and celebrate a birthday here. For a fine dining experience, where apparently many celebrities like to go, this place was so very disappointing! They must either serve the \"rich and famous\" something completely different or the \"rich and famous\" have no concept of what excellent food is. Our server was fantastic; however, you could tell they were very short staffed as he and the busboy were very hurried. When our server came to our table, he was very friendly and wonderful. Too bad he did not come by that often. He did mention that they were short staffed and that the kitchen was very busy. A few times the busboy would almost throw our cutlery down on the table when resetting for the next course. He was also not consistent in setting down the cutlery. Knives facing different directions for each person or spoons on different sides of the knife or fork. Normally I would not care that much but when I go to a fine dining restaurant, I expect to receive a fine dining experience. The main reason for coming here was to have exceptional Italian food. The food itself was mostly good but it wasn\\'t mind blowing in anyway and did not inspire us to to come back. Especially not for the prices this place was charging. Here\\'s what we had: * Frittura Mista Di Pesce- Buttermilk-battered and deep fried shrimp and calamari with tartare sauce - the oil was clean and everything was fresh. It\\'s deep fried calamari and shrimp, nothing overly complicated. * Polpo Alla Puttanesca - Grilled octopus served with cherry tomatoes from Pachino, black olives, anchovies and capers from Pantelleria - the octopus was grilled well and not over done. The tomatoes were nice and fresh. It was good but not the best I\\'ve had. * Carpaccio Di Filetto Di Manzo Con Tartufo Nero Di Norcia E Stracciatella Di Burrata - Tomatoes with fresh black truffle from Norcia and burrata Stracciatella cheese - one of the most disappointing dishes! The Burrata was served to us too cold and the creamy centre wasn\\'t creamy at all. Made me wonder if we even got Burrata or if we got Mozzarella. There is a difference! * Fettuccine Alla Bolognese Di Mamma Laura - \"Little Ribbon\" fettucine with Mamma\\'s famous fresh homemade meat sauce - simple dish of pasta noodles with meat sauce. It was quite bland. I think the kitchen forgot the salt. * La Carbonara - Artisanal Zaccagni spaghetti tossed with crispy pork cheek from Amatrice, eggs, Sarawak black pepper and Roman *DOP Pecorino cheese - the sauce on this dish was  well seasoned and quite delicious! However, the spaghetti was undercooked. It wasn\\'t al dente, it was undercooked. When we finally had a chance to tell the server, he explained how the pasta chef is \"Roman\" and how the Romans feel this is how pasta should be cooked. He even mentioned that he\\'s had many debates about this with the chef in the past. Basically we were served undercooked pasta on purpose. He suggested that next time we should let them know that we want our pasta al dente, the Italian way. Seriously? If you know this is what your kitchen is going to do, then you should inform your customers at the time of ordering. * Bistecca Alla Brace - Grilled Prime Canadian striploin with mushrooms au jus - nice huge juicy steak with a good amount of sides but nothing super special. * Costoletta Di Vitello - Grilled white provimi veal chop - tender and juicy; however, another dish served under season. Since our table was sharing everything, the kitchen cut the veal for us. * Cheesecake with fresh fruit compote, strawberry Tiramisu, Classic Italian Tiramisu, Ricotta Cheesecake with Pears and Almond Crust - the highlight of the dinner! All the desserts were delicious and presented beautifully on one large plate. Our favourite was the Ricotta Cheesecake with Pears and Almond Crust. All in all, the food was good but did not meet expectations. Since the kitchen was so slow and we were getting really hungry, we only told our server about the food experience we had after eating. There are so many other wonderful places you can go to great Italian food and a fine dining experience. This was not one of them. If you have money to burn and are into chance celebrity sightings (which we did not care about), go ahead and come here. If you want consistent, impeccable service and food that would make you want to come back the next day, go somewhere else.',\n",
              " \"Such a disappointing meal and honestly so embarrassed that I suggested this place to my friends. The carbonara was probably one of the worst we have had. It was the one pasta dish our server suggested, 3 of us got it. The carbonara was so salty, cheesy and the pasta was so undercooked. We also suspect it to be cream base because it was so saucy, almost like soup. It was awful. We all had a few bites and left 3/4 of the plate untouched. We ordered the calamari and shrimp to start. It was fresh and pretty good. The bread was also not bad, nothing special. The service was average, our server seemed annoyed explaining the specials to us. Mid way telling us the specials, he asked if we are really interested in knowing the specials... He was quick at refilling our waters. That's probably because they don't offer tap water. So we were suckered into buying bottled water. We spent $40 on water alone, for four people. It's an expensive meal, which I'm honestly ok paying, if it's a good meal. This was not worth it at all, and I don't recommend.\",\n",

The ambiance, service, and food were all excellent. My friends and I split three small plates/apps, the cheeseburger spring rolls, Singapore style slaw, and Yucatan goat cheese tart. All three were great, but the slaw was the unanimous favorite. It was so light and fresh with lots of textures and, even with so many ingredients, tasted excellent all together. The cheeseburger spring rolls were the weakest in my opinion, but not to say they weren't good. Just not as flavorful as the other plates. They had a 2.5 oz A5 Miyazaki Wagyu on special so I ordered that because I've always wanted to try Miyazaki Wagyu. It did not disappoint! The price was surprisingly fair ($65 CAD/$50 USD) for such a stellar cut of meat. The smaller portion was still filling, especially since the meat is so rich. Melted in my mouth and was worth every bit the hype. It came with pickled radish (a favorite of mine), parmesan frites, and daikon with mustard. Every bite was so flavorful and I left very satisfied. We also split the All Time Favorites dessert tasting plate (eight pieces) and it was more than enough for us all. My favorite was the tong yuen, it tasted like a fancy (and much better) Asian-inspired Ferrero Rocher. Sometimes restaurants from famous chefs don't live up to the hype, but Lee definitely does.

I tried one drink, requested to change it and the second one wasn't significantly better, but I appreciated the server's willingness to fix it.

It is such an unforgettable dish. Their pasta is cooked Al dente and paired perfectly with their creamy white truffle sauce. I always try a new pizza whenever I'm there too. I got their Salsicce pizza and it is topped with sausages, dandelion greens, chilled, pecorino cheese and garlic oil. I love how much meat was on the pizza, but I was a little too heavy for the thin crust pizza though. The service was not necessarily the best that night and I found the servers a little slow and inattentive. The ambiance was nice though: moody warm vibes, and dim lightings.

              " 'I had been wanting to try Gusto for a while and finally went for my anniversary dinner. I had made a reservation earlier in the week through OpenTable and wanted to make sure our table would still be available since we were running quite late. I was disappointed at the lack of communication by the restaurant staff as I tried calling multiple times but was unable to reach anyone. I messaged on OpenTable and did not get a response either. While being late is completely on me as the diner, it seems quite unprofessional that no one picked up the phone despite their own reservation policies. When we got there, the restaurant was already very busy on a Saturday night. The ambience was loud and lively, and the decor matched the vibes. We were given a table upstairs right at the doorway and quickly realized how terrible the table was. When our server put down our bottle of water, it started sliding off the table because it was just that slanted! We asked to be moved to a better table and was promptly guided to a table downstairs. Although the rest of the evening went perfectly fine, I wonder why the restaurant staff felt that this table seating was appropriate for any diner! In terms of the food, we ordered the Burrata, a salad, the Funghi pizza and cheesecake for dessert. The burrata was delicious and great starter! The flavours and texture of the dish went perfectly together, especially the candied walnuts which gave a nice hint of sweetness. The salad was also solid but nothing much to write home about. The Funghi pizza was loaded with mushrooms; the dough was thin and the crust was soft and chewy! Very much enjoyed it. We rounded off dinner with the cheesecake which tasted a lot like a Japanese cheesecake to me in both flavour and texture. It was light and cakey at the same time; the berry compote gave a nice tartness to complement the sweet. Overall, I enjoyed the food here, portion sizes were good for two people but service could have been better. The restaurant was quite busy and our server seemed to be flustered the whole night.',\n",

They change their cocktail menu often & each time, I start off disappointed that they don't have what I had previously ordered, then completely loving a new cocktail. Food is great too. This time, I chose the FUNGHI (shiitake, oyster mushroom, mozzarella, taleggio, pecorino, caramelized onion) SO good! Perfectly balanced flavours & burnt crust, just the way I like it. Adored my cocktail too: L'ABETE (dillon's gin, st. germaine, apricot, grapefruit, rhubarb bitters). Absolute perfection. My guy had the GUSTO BRUNCH BURGER (cheddar, herb remoulade, caramelized onion, pickles, egg, tuscan fries) & loved it. Fries were great!

I have started to appreciate vegetarian items now though so enjoy a good vegetable dish. With high recommendations coming from a vegan friend who tried their food at a vegan festival not to mention a fellow yelper who I feel has a similar palate to moi I had high expectations. First the interior a nice welcoming space with good color scheme and reasonable dinnerware/flatware. However the washrooms are located upstairs and don't have locks!! quite unnerving. We were here for a brunch so decided to order large plates and ordered an app of cauliflower tots to share. The drink list is extensive with some interesting cocktails and a few health focused drinks.  My dinning companions (DC's) and I ordered a bottle of Cava (decent) and one person stuck to Beau's beer. The app was decent (most of deep fried stuff ought to be :) Now for the main I ordered a crab cake and DC's ordered the burger. The mains took their time to arrive meanwhile we enjoyed the pleasant setup. They have the look down pat of a crab cake IMO. The first bite reminded of Japanese dish Okonomiyaki (I luv that dish) and the salad it was served on was good (nice tangy and then sweet notes) Hmm I didn't enjoy this dish as it had a lingering aftertaste. There was something heavy about this dish (the crust or the absorbed oil) that was of putting to the extent that I couldn't finish it. My DC's were OK with their burger. I tried the fries and wasn't impressed with the overwhelming paprika. I guess this place is trying to bring mainstream folks by offering faux versions of popular dishes. However in these two examples the results weren't good. I might revisit as am starting to explore this area and would try a vegan dish which is vegan in the first place. So far 2 stars for food with a half star bump for service/ambiance.\",\n",

The miso soup was extremely salty more than usual for a miso soup. 1 star The octopus balls had so much potential too, the filling inside the balls were yummy and had 5 star potential but then they didn\\'t cook the octopus well so it was so chewy it wasn\\'t edible and I had to spit it out. 2.5 stars The rest of the food was also a bit un-noteworthy.

With every precise slice, artful assembly, and graceful presentation, they transform the freshest, highest quality ingredients into edible masterpieces. Each course in the Omakase lineup unravels like chapters in a story, each more compelling than the last, guiding your senses through a tantalizing array of flavours and textures.

The balance between the neta (topping) and shari (rice) is impeccable, reflecting a deep understanding and respect for the craft.

Their recommendations on sake pairings further elevate the Omakase journey.

I really enjoyed that there were a couple of new dishes I have never tried before (herring eggs on kelp and smoked bonito). We ended with a refreshing yuzu sorbet. As previously mentioned, bill may come as a sticker shock. 18% gratuity is already added on (post-tax) so you do not have to add anything additional on. Overall, a pleasant dining experience.

Surprisingly my favourite was the cod testicle, super creamy, no fishy flavours, subtle sweetness and very delightful to eat. The monkfish liver was a good one too, again rich and decadent but not rubbery as they poached it. Well seasoned and creamy! Saba was definitely still fishy, but the fresh type with a hint of yuzu.

Before starting, this lovely hostess asked if we have allegies or preferences, to which i said, i don't prefer anything liver or kidney.  Her answer was, we serve only seafood, nothing land. Other than the attitude of this hostess, i really enjoyed everything else from the evening.  I liked the way the sushi chef presented each dish, telling us what they are and where each of the sea (ahem not land) animal is from.  The sashimi plate consisted of a large prawn and a couple of slices of fish.  It was visually beautiful.   And each of the sushi presented all looked and tasted different from each other.

What we got: Onion soup Scallop en croûte Wild pacific halibut 16oz p.e.i. rib eye The onion soup and the scallop were good, but the entrees were crazy disappointing. Even though the halibut was cooked very well, the flavors did not go well together. At least it came with mashed potatoes. The rib eye was even worse. The quality of the steak being thin, chewy, & fatty did not meet its price point. It also did not have a char or enough seasoning. The piece we had did not even include the rib cap.

We ordered a couple of cocktails and a bottle of wine to start. The cocktails and glassware were quite pretty, though the taste was just average for the most part. The food all seemingly had one thing in common: the lack of cohesion. It's clear the ingredients were paired to bring various flavours to the dish, but the dish simply tasted like each ingredient separately. This was quite noticeable in each dish with exception to the steak. One dish to point out was the scallop pictured, which was definitely a little underwhelming, as it almost seems like more effort was placed on plating than the food. We also expected more than one scallop to be served at this price point. My recommendation is to come here for the view and the drinks. It's quite romantic if you appreciate the luxe vibe, though being situated near the top of TD tower may make it feel more like a business environment instead.\",\n",

The curry has small Parisienne potatoes, peanuts, tamarind, and your choice of  chicken, pork, tofu veggie. Sub beef/pork $1.50 extra or shrimp/fish $2.50 extra. There's a hint of sweetness from the tamarind sauce, and you can sip the broth like a soup.  So satisfying... You get a decent serving of Jasmine rice The Tom Yum soup was a delicious medley of cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and tofu. The fresh roll consisted of tofu carrots and lettuce wrapped in rice paper. Chili tamarind sauce to dip. The presentation looked beautiful on the narrow plate. Three flavours pad thai $17.99 you have a choice of heat level:  0- no spice 1 - mild 2 - medium 3 - spicy 6 - Thai spicy 8 - Extreme thai spicy 12 - Chef top spicy.  I got it mild because I know how spicy it can get. The pad thai was perfectly assembled with crushed peanuts on top. The glass noodles were cooked with a tangy tamarind sauce with a generous serving of chicken breast meat. The portion was huge for lunch portions. We had some takeout!

They\\'ve got more ciders than you thought existed. Pear cider, cherry cider, champagne cider, Thai cider, spicy cider, dessert ice cider, and um, just cider. I started with the Revel \"good evening\" cider and it was gorgeously sour, like a lime squeezed into a lemon wrapped in a tart apple. It was delicious. I would make it my summer drink if it was summer. Alas, next year. The food was fitting of a highly rated gastro pub. We started with the carrot and zucchini fritters, crispy on the outside and soft and tasty on the middle. The beet salad was fresh, with green apple and a chèvre dressing...more apt for the summer months, like the Revel. The scallops were done just right. And they were nice and big. Finally, the fried chicken karage style were delectable with a sweet heat and juicy dark meat pieces perfectly battered and fried. We had the quince tart to close and it was a strong choice. Butter-forward but not heavy due to the light pastry and subtle flavour of stewed quince, not too sweet. Finally, what a beautiful space and great service! So cosy but also sophisticated.

The host quickly checked to see if they had space on the heated patio (our preference) and we got lucky!  They explained they were having heater issues, but it was nothing a little tape couldn't solve and we were perfectly toasty all night! We ended up sharing a cider flight (a Niagara peach Chardonnay, a KW Thai ginger, and a spruce one I can't remember). All 3 were excellent!! The KW Thai ginger was unique and similar to kombucha so I loved it. For food, we ordered a few things to share. First was a salad with cucumber, tomato, a crab vinaigrette, feta, and roasted chickpeas. That was my favourite. The dressing was incredible. We also ordered the French fries which came with a chipotle aioli and a apple fennel ketchup. The fries were great but that ketchup was the real star!  We also tried the fried chicken which was also good!  Finally, the birria sliders which came with consommé for dipping. They were good but the consommé could have used a bit more.

In the restarant, there are two sides once you enter. On the left is the dimmer area with plenty of tables and chairs (almost feels like you're at a club!). There's good hip music playing as well so the atmosphere is lively for those looking to have a good night. You can also see the chefs in action as the bar seating and open kitchen is just across on the other side of the area. On the right side is where diners need to take off their shoes as it is more of a traditional Japanese seating area where you could sit with your legs crossed on a cushion. The place is great for both shareables and drinks. The sake bombs are always popular and gets the staff involved in cheering. Shareables were also delicious - my personal favourites were the original karaage and the prawn tempura. I also really liked the salmon oshizushi.\",\n",

The service we got all night was very attentive and helpful. The staff around the restaurant answered all of our questions about the menu which led to a very positive experience. The food itself was really delicious. We started off with the calamari, which is a must. We also got the grilled octopus, fish of the day sea bream, Leonardo spaghetti, and a risotto. All the fish was grilled really nicely, and the pastas packed a lot of flavor. My personal favourite dish was the Leonardo spaghetti. It had a really nice simple lemon sauce that tasted amazing. For dessert we got the tiramisu the cookies and my personal favourite the lemon sorbet, which was served in a frozen lemon peel. I thought the presentation was very interesting and it was a really nice refreshing dessert to end the meal. Overall, we had a really nice time and I would definitely recommend josos for either a date or a night out with a group.\",\n",

First, it was too loud. Not so loud that we had to shout to make each other heard, but loud enough to be annoying.

Additionally, I completely understand training staff; however I could hear exactly what was being taught to new members. Our server was sweet and made good recommendations.

The weakest dish here though was definitely the pork secreto. It was pork without any delicious fats or herbs, and it became a fairly dry piece of meat.

The host seated us almost immediately and the service was pretty good overall. It definitely gives high end but also diner vibes. As for the food, we ordered 4 things including the tuna tartare with uni, lamb ragu pappardelle and the grilled octopus. The octopus was cooked perfectly and I liked the sauce, it was flavorful but I wish I had a carb to balance it out. The pappardelle was cooked very nicely and I loved how the lamb complemented it. The lamb was tender but also a little crispy which gave the dish another level of texture. The tuna tartare and uni was good but it was a tad fishy for my liking. As for drinks, I loved that they were served in a chilled glass. I got the strawberry daiquiri and it was refreshing and perfect with my meal. Aloette is definitely on the pricier side and although I was satisfied from my meal, the portion sizes are almost tapas size.\",\n",

Fancy but not overly hoity toity. I mean the tables are maroon-colored formica and it just WORKS (and makes me want it in my house lol) The 90s hip hop bumping on the speakers was the cherry on top. Now that I'm done waxing poetic about the space -- let's talk the important stuff: the food & drank! The cocktail menu is small but super creative. The bartenders also know wsup; I asked for a paper plane and they made a stellar paper plane. We had the: *Beef Tartare Crostini - fennel, egg yolk, jalapeño- great lil' bites! no complaints! *'Nduja Stuffed Olives - halloumi, sourdough, chimichurri - love the presentation on metal cocktail picks. Really nice savory bite and quite flavorful. *East Coast Oysters - tiger's milk mignonette - probably one of the best if not the best migonette I've had. Migonette is my preferred topping on oysters so I've had quite a few variations now and this one is killer! *Iceberg Wedge - avocado, chive cream, puffed wild rice - WOW, not your grandmother's iceberg wedge. I don't even usually like iceberg wedge, but this had such good flavor, textures..perfection. It was also huge - plenty to share with a dining companion. *Aloette Burger - beaufort cheese, onion, lettuce - the beaufort cheese on this was a thing of beauty. It was sliced thicc and square and pan fried (?) on both sides. *Fries - because a burger must have fries and these were damn good french fries! Handcut. Thicker. Freshly fried. delish. no notes.

There was also chicken and turkey breast which i did not eat. Honestly, at this point, we were quite full (all the other courses were very generously sized) and we ended up taking the rest to go.

This is a Texas BBQ joint, a cuisine I haven\\'t really ever explored. To start, the interior is really classy and modern looking, and a lot bigger than it looks on the outside. Their Summerlicious menu consists of 3 courses. For the appetizer, I chose the caesar salad which came as two big chunks of lettuce that you cut up to make your salad. It sounds weird but I actually enjoyed it! The other options were salmon tartare and a mini birria quesadilla, which my friends both opted for - and they said both were good. For our main, we all chose the same thing: the pit platter, so the kitchen put all of our orders together on a huge platter (as the name suggests). There was enough for everyone to get two ribs, two slices of beef brisket, and more than a spoonful of pulled pork each. They had three \"hot\" sauces that I think are made in-house (?) but none of them were really that hot. As for the meat, the ribs were really tender and fell off the bone. They paired really well with the sweet \\'n spicy sauce offered. The brisket was my favourite; the flavour was so good and it paired well with the espresso hot sauce. And finally, I\\'m not a huge fan of pulled pork, but theirs wasn\\'t too bad. My dessert was the coconut creme pie and the coconut was super overpowering. I wish I had gotten the banoffie pie - it had a great texture and was much more pleasant to eat than the dry coconut.

We took the burden of decisions off our hands and selected \"the experience\", which is a curated meal. A couple of starters, a seafood item, salad, then the platter (which you can get on its own), and dessert for the finish. The pie, which I wish I could remember the name of, was decadent and I could eat a whole bowl of that. Even after eating all that heavy heavy meat. So, go hear hungry and don\\'t plan to go out dancing afterwards. I\\'d recommend you find a plush chair with a cigar to let your gut do it\\'s job.

The lamb was mediocre and the accompanying risotto was the best part of that dish. The salmon was very basic and under seasoned, sides were also underwhelming.

The initial reservation process was easy, and we were able to get an early dinner table for New years Eve. There was a prefixe menu available for the night - no gratuity specified. Service was alright, felt a little rush/quick. They kept clearing things from the table right away and setting down courses before we were done with the last. I thought they were just being really attentive but thinking back, they just wanted turnover. The food was alright. The initial course you can choose cheese or deli meats. I find it a bit odd that they don\\'t offer a small mix of both. I literally received 3 pieces of cheese while my bf got a plate of salami and charcuterie meats. The appetizer was great. I had the carpaccio while my bf enjoyed their Bosco pear salad with beets. We ordered non alcoholic drinks as well which were super disappointing. I got pear nectar soda and he got peach. They tasted nothing like the fruits. It was essentially soda water, but I really just didn\\'t want to bother.  At $10 each, I would recommend you take a pass. Just order wine My bf got the beef tenderloin which he thoroughly enjoyed and I ordered the branzino. I enjoyed the flavor but I was disappointed with the skin on the fish. It was super soggy which created a bad mouth feel. Otherwise the dish was good. I wouldn\\'t order it again though. Dessert was alright. I\\'m not a dessert person so my bf enjoyed it all. There was an orange Panna cotta, tiramisu slice, poached pear and cannoli. The cannoli was really soggy. I think they pre filled these a while before serving. Disappointing for a restaurant of this style and caliber. Now here is why I took this from a 4 star to a 2.  When paying our bill, the server didn\\'t give us our space to do the gratuity. He actually watched my bf type the percentage. It was generous but I guess he didn\\'t feel it was generous enough because he TOOK THE MACHINE FROM MY BOYFRIEND AND SAID \"here, I\\'ll do it for you\". He then entered a higher percentage and then told us it\\'s new years Eve. Now, I\\'m not here to start the to tipping culture conversation. But tips are optional and up to the guest to decide. At no point is it up to the server to take the machine and enter what they want. It was incredibly rude and my bf had no idea how to react to that. So the server takes the machine, enters his own gratuity, and has the audacity to tell us it\\'s standard for the night. You bet I talked to the host and FOH manager right after. I\\'ve worked hospitality for years. Gratuity can be set for group reservations or sometimes events, but it was not at all the case this night. The host and managers got the servers name from us and they apologized. The manager was very kind to gift us a certificate and welcomed us to return again another night. I hope they realize they need to keep a closer eye on what the heck their servers are doing upstairs. They seem to be running some sketchy show up there. That server reflects poorly on his team. I wouldn\\'t want that guy serving my guests. If you get a server and they ever dare to tell you how much to tip them, you say no. It\\'s not ok. They are never to take that machine from you to enter their own number. They don\\'t get to do that. It\\'s incredibly rude and unethical. We\\'re unsure if we\\'d want to return.

So this hits good in terms of creaminess, however, it could definitely be more tastier. There also wasn't enough mushrooms compared to Gusto. All in all, pretty decent Mushroom pasta & I would def have it again - lowkey a comfort food of mine Rigatoni Bolognese - huge portions, the usual expectation you can have for a bolognese dish, could have more sauce tho! Tiramisu - again, another huge plate! I'm loving the portions here, & you can actually taste the coffee taste They plenty of patio seating, we ended up in the rooftop, unfortunately the views were blocked by curtains as it was chilly that night.

Turns out, Nervosa lives up to the hype. But what I didn't know is that they're owned by the same group as Gusto 101 and Gusto 501, so some of the dishes are the same, and the food is fantastic. We started with the margherita pizza, and it was everything you want in a great pizza - the perfectly charred crust, nice chew on the dough, and the sauce hit just right with the perfect amount of tang and sweetness. After that we got their classic truffle mushroom pasta and rigatoni bolognese which were both delicious. They also had some great bottles of lambrusco (sparkling red wine) which helped craft the perfect summer vibe on their patio. Overall it was an excellent meal, and I can't wait to come back!\",\n",

I had an aperol spritz which was an aperol spritz so no complaints there. I ordered the Mezzi Rigatoni Bolognese and what I got was nothing short of great. The pasta had a great bouncy texture and the sauce was rich and decadent. I threw on some hot pepper flakes and that elevated the bolognese even more. Will have to try more things but if it's anything like the bolognese, I'm excited to try!\",\n",

Both delicious and fresh! I was full, without feeling that draining carb overload. The service was fantastic and, surprisingly, it wasn't too busy when we went on a Friday night.

Once we finally got a table, we got some food (as one does). I got the Mediterranean Pizza, which was fine and not very flavourful. I feel like I could have gotten something similar from Pi Co for less $. We also tried the Risotto Nervosa, which was small in size and quite unremarkable. I'm not a chef by any means, but I've cooked Mushroom Risotto that tasted similar. For dessert we got Tiramisu, which was pretty good. It was just sweet enough and I enjoyed the creamy part on top. We sat upstairs which was a bit crowded, but cozy. It is inevitable to have someone bump into you at least once while sitting. Overall, not a bad place for some Italian fare, but you will have to wait 30+ minutes to get a table and likely drop $40+ for a decent meal.\",\n",

They mention in the menu that the homefries are with their \"legendary sauce\", highkey just tastes like ketchup. Instead of a side of pancakes or waffles as with other diners its a pathetic piece of rye bread cut in half. Service was slow overall, took them a while to get us cutlery and water set up.

It is not mando to have it, but it is a downfall. I was visiting from California so it makes it difficult to park on the streets without having internet or wifi connection. Not the restaurants problem, but I asked for help or a solution to parking and no one was able to assist. The menu looks straight forward, but there were too many options. 13 bowls, 1 tsukemen dipping ramen, 2 rice bowls and appetizers to choose from. That's alot of options!  This is by far the most expensive ramen I have ever paid for. And I live in the bay area where things are jacked up expensive. Luckily the exchange rate was good when I went and the conversion wasn't so bad. With 4 people, we all got different bowls - Red dragon, spicy red miso, roasted garlic shoyu and the shoyu tsukemen. They all were good in their own ways. One downfall to this place is that the bowls don't come with much. You literally have to add extra toppings that range from $1-$8.5 and you can see bowls will come out even more expensive. The menu has pictures but doesn't actually tell you what's in every bowl. Service was great which is pretty rare for an asian establishment! Our server was very sweet and took his time telling us what was included in each of the individual bowls. And yooooo, they serve you hella noodles. The asian in me did not want to waste food, but boy oh boy.... This ramen won.. We also came close to closing so maybe they were just pushing out what they had left. Regardless, it was appreciated!\",\n",

The food, service, and the atmosphere were top-notch as Isshin Ramen is a great place to get a delicious and authentic ramen experience. We started off with a shared plate of Hiya Yakko, which is cold tofu smothered with their secret freshly made chili oil, with green onions and bamboo shoots delicately layered on top. It was a refreshing and flavorful start to the meal. For our main entrees, I ordered the Isshin Red Miso ramen which set the food mood as it had a wonderful aroma. The thick and wavy noodles were perfect as the ground tofu and wood ear mushrooms were able to intermingle with the noodle's waves nicely. The depth and dimensions were outstanding. My Hubby had the Vegetarian Roasted Garlic Shoyu which my Hubby declared was delicious, with two varieties of mushrooms: shiitake and button. Both our noodles had the perfect bounce and the soups were rich, we quaffed all of it. We concluded our meal with Kakigori Hochi Cha. Our shaved ice was very different from the Korean Bingsu we were accustomed to, as we found this to be more refreshing. The Japanese Kakigori is ice based and made from water. The ice had been grounded down to flakes and then the sweet milky Hochi cha was adorned on top of the ice flakes. Beyond sublime! It was a seasonal special so always ask what their seasonal desserts are and save room for them. My only suggestion is for the servers to take away the trays, as the tables are a bit tight. This is a minor suggestion, but didn't detract from my overall experience. Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Value: 5/5\",\n",

The best part is that they handle all their meats in house and use every part of an animal in their dishes. Drinks were refreshing and recommended by our server based on our preferences. Definitely let your server know what your palette enjoys and they will be sure to find something that you like. Food. Let's get started with food. The Nodini - warm bread knots with olive oil, rosemary and garlic were great to share amongst the table. Perfectly sized 2 biters to start your meal with. Harder shell on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Spaghetti Al Nero Di Maiale - this is a port blood pasta, 'nduja di buca, wild leek, stracciatella. Don't get intimidated by this dish as it does not taste iron-y at all. A nice change to your regular tomato sauce spaghetti. Get this if you're feeling a little adventurous. Strozzapreti Al Ragu - delicious! Well balanced flavours with tender pieces of ragu. Pasta was perfectly cooked to al dente. A little on the heavier side, a lot of oil at the bottom of my plate once the dish was consumed. But still very delicious! Gnocchi Ripieni - did not personally try this. But the presentation of this dish was beautiful! Perfect for any vegetarians or pescatarians! Finished off with a waffle dessert that was nice, airy and light - hints of lemon. Don't recall the full name of this dessert but it was delicious and the best highlight of the meal!\",\n",

I still don't know what I ate. The food was very different, still good, but not being from  (or Italy), I had no idea what to expect or what I was getting.  The sauce was brown, not red, and the dish had a very salty taste to it.  The Cab went very well with it.  Our group ordered a number of appetizers that were all very good. This was a bit of an experience.  I almost felt as though I was in a French restaurant - wine and several courses over about three hours. Service seemed slow, but again, I wasn't sure what to expect.  This is not Americanized Italian food.\",\n",

Heirloom Tomatoes & Tonnato was marked as $16 which I thought was pretty expensive for tomatoes. I was wrong. Okay, it is still pretty pricy but we wanted to lick the plate because the dressing/sauce (?) was that delicious. Jamon Croquetas was also a decent choice. It is a creamy ham croquette with mashed potatoes. This is a tapas bar after all, so don't expect to get full after the dishes. Also ordered several drinks and cocktails including Say Less, Magic City, and See U Never. Every drink was pleasant. See U Never was my personal favorite because I loveee the taste of yuzu and sour flavors in general. Plus, the interior is super cool! It seemed casual yet formal at the same time. We did not really have a designated seat. Instead, about half of the people were probably standing around the big table that's connected to the wall.\",\n",
              " 'We arrived shortly after 6 pm. Once inside, I felt as if I were in another world. It was before sunset time, but the inside was dark/dim with unique indirect lighting fixtures. The space was small - it was like a hideout cave in the city :) A server greeted us and said \"wherever you want\" - there are a few high-top tables, window counter areas, and a bar counter area with a limited number of bar stools. Essentially, it is a standing bar. All the bar stools were already taken by earlier visitors. As time passes, many people entered and grab drinks. Some are in groups, some are solo. In spite of the small size of the space and the number of people inside, I did not feel my private space was invaded by others. Maybe because of the way they arrange the lighting? Comfortable. We had Food: (From  CONSERVAS -Canned seafood): Razor Clams (From PINTXOS - small snack) :Stracciatella & Boquerones (From TAPAS - appetizers) : Octopus & Sobrassada Drink: - Cocktail specially made for my girlfriend\\'s preference (gin based, fruity, and fizzy) - See You No More - Raval Martini - Left Field \\'Greenwood IPA\\' - Burdock APA (on tap) - Estrella Damm (Spanish Lager) We loved Stracciatella & Boquerones. A layer of milky, slightly sweet, super melty fresh cheese, silky marinated white anchovy, and a thin slice of crispy bread. Enjoyed all these different textures and flavors. The refreshing parsley sauce on top perfected the dish. Wow to the Octopus & Sobrassada. Octopus pieces are hot and crisp outside but tender inside. The pieces of Sobrassada (Spanish cured sausage) transferred their flavor - saltiness, sourness, and spiciness onto other ingredients, and harmonized the taste of the dish. The paprika in Sobrassada rounded the flavor and gave it an appetizing red color. Yum! We had Razor clams for the first time (we were a bit nervous :) - it was chewy and soft, which was a pleasant surprise! Among all the drinks - my girlfriend and I both agreed that \"See You No More\" was the best.:) Highly recommend. Of course, the prices are higher than other bars.

When we looked online, there wasn\\'t much of a waitlist, but as we were about to go 45-30mins in advance, we added ourselves to the digital waitlist and found ourselves in a long line. Perhaps everyone added themselves to the waitlist around the same time. We had to wait nearly an additional hour once we got there on a weekend evening. Their digital waitlist isn\\'t that accurate at all! The atmosphere is lively, great vibes and dimly lit. We were \"seated\" in a section with small high round tables with a sprinkle of stools around that section. There are not enough seats for all the tables. We were lucky and took it upon ourselves to grab stools to sit down when another table emptied next to us. Otherwise, expect to stand and enjoy your drinks and bites. The quality of the food and cocktails are next level. It blew us away, well thought out and refined. Not one dish disappointed. The standout has to be the Mushroom Tower. Price point is about $15~ for cocktails and $15-20 per tapa sharable among 2-3. They can also add more single portions so there is never that awkward sharing moment.

The Celery Root and Scallop dishes were amazing. Pretty plating and a perfect balance of flavours. The Tagliatelle was a bit underwhelming compared to the other dishes; it's decent but nothing special. I would try the Hand Torn Noodles next time.

We then shared a fantastic peach grilled cake dessert with a basil cream underneath and peanut brittle with peach ice cream.

Great meal experience overall. This place gets high accolades (it also appears on the Michelin guide honourable mentions), and it did not disappoint. Food: 5/5 ======== The food is most delicious. Each dish was well-thought-out. You can tell that they are serious about their food, as they have a big open gallery kitchen that is teaming with activity. Here's what we got: Smoked fish appetizer - $16. Most delicious spread. Very smokey. Was served with super thin potato chips. At first I thought it was weird to have a chip instead of a cracker, but it actually worked beautifully. Must try dish. Kampachi - $22 - delicious crudo. Must try. Celery root salad - $18 - very nice. Cauliflower - $18 - very nice. Skate - $35 - very delicious. Was very rich, like a braised beef. Five Spice Cake - $12. Yum! I LOVE five spice, and the cake did the spice mix justice. One complaint I had was that the cocktail list was basically non-existent. The one cocktail I tried (Bitter Spritz 18$) was not great (diluted, sweet and no bitters). The wine options were very expensive. I opted for the Saison beer (Burdock Tuesday $9), and I was not disappointed. Service: 4/5 ========= The service was mostly friendly, but a little lukewarm. The server knew the dishes very well, and was able to remember the options by heart. Very casual style of service overall (complete with hipster scruffy outfits), which is somewhat nice, and at the same time leaves you wanting a little more  warmth and elegance. Ambiance: 5/5 ============ The ambiance overall is very nice. Let's start with the fact that the restaurant is located in hipster-central: Kensington Market. At the same time, it's definitely elevated for the neighbourhood. The place is very casual, but not without elegance. The decor is grungy, but not without style. The lights are nice and dim. It's definitely warm and rather romantic. You could definitely come here on a first date. The playlist was amazing. I kept wanting to Shazam the songs. Value: 3/5 ======== The small plates are rather expensive. You won't leave here stuffed. At the same time, you feel like you are getting rewarded with great tasting plates.

My boyfriend got the lamb shoulder (not pictured) that was a bit tough? Normally you'd expect the meat to melt in your mouth more but it was a bit hard to chew, not to mention the flavor was just ok.

I have never heard about this place before until my friend told me about it, and we both came with high expectations. what we ordered: 1. Red Tail Bread ~ butter: this 6 dollar dish is my absolutely fav of the night, i honest prob could just order 5 of them and be very happy and satisfied, it is so soft, and the butter is so airy too, if cloud has a form and is edible, that must be how it tastes like 2. Cod: it was 38 dollars, and it is a small piece of cod which is flaky, the sauce tho, it was amazing , i have to say i would be much happier if i can have more fish with more of that sauce with that price. but this just makes me hungry by looking at it. 3. Sweet Potato Cake: it is indeed very good as all the other reviews say, i enjoyed it a lot. some areas where I think can be improved: 1. i think the sign needs to change, in the dark there is absolutely no way to tell the name since its grey on grey without any lights. i know it is aesthetic, but it is not friendly to anyone's eyes 2. the bathroom situation is extremely weird, they have a big area downstairs where there are events /group dinners held, but there are also several bathrooms downstairs, while upstairs there is 1, and where there is any event, eveyrone else upstairs need to wait on the one together and trust me it was not a pleasant line. i had to wait and wait and wait until it was my turn, if your upstairs is already that busy, and there is no way to open another bathroom, why even use the downstairs as a private event place?\",\n",

Fortunately, we were sitting indoors, but if you're in the patio, the preferred seat is facing the restaurant, as long as you don't mind looking into the park of homelessness across the street. I'm sure you won't be harassed for pocket change as the restaurant has been there long enough for the vagrants to be respectful. I would recommend that your server write down your order if you have more than 3-4 items. We were offered a complimentary dessert for a forgotten dish and a overly savoury dish. Good gesture. If I was with a boring date, I would have had to spend another 30-45 gruelling minutes before I can politely dismiss my date. However, with the right date, this is more time with your sweetheart. Overall, food satisfaction is just a touch above average, but the table seating inside makes up for quite a bite. Somewhat attentive staff, but I do find a little repulsive the reuse of the same damp table rag for wiping down table surfaces for all tables for as long as we were there. One would think a rinse after each use would be warranted. Oh, if you have a bladder problem, be warned, the wait for the single washroom could be annoying.

Comes with a nice mini Sourdough roll.  I had the Schnitzel which was great.  It comes with potato salad and frites (which is a little too much potato for me -- so I switched up the frites for their house salad which was great). Fantastic selection of beers, but also a decent and reasonable wine list. There was no sparkling wine by the glass (we were celebrating her engagement!) - but we just went for the bottle! It has some lively vibe and obviously a popular spot (all tables were taken for the full 2-1/2 hours we were there). There is even a cool spot for singles to sit along an eating bar that faces into the kitchen.  Tres cool. I am thinking next time I will have to try those mussels, although I saw lots of good offerings go by (nice looking burger and pulled pork sandwich as well as a Cheese Fondue - which is not something you typically see!).

We were seated and left alone with nothing. No menus or water for quite a bit of time. Finally, our server came and served us water. The menu was simple for lunch, several choices in handheld items but not many others besides mussels and one steak. Coworkers ordered tacos and they did not come with any sides so we also ordered the Belgian Frites. The tacos looked kind of small, the order came with four wonton sized pieces. The description on the menu for the Belgian Frites sounded amazing. \"Blanched in beef tallow & duck fat\" accompanied by two house made sauces. Unfortunately, the frites fell flat. The frites itself was not evenly fried, most of the pieces were soft. The sauces were bland and almost flavourless. I ordered the Steak Sandwich and it was okay. The striploin was done right, medium rare as requested. The bistro salad was overdressed, it was drenched in sauce. Overall, would not be back again.

It\\'s a brown ale which was new to me. Definitely a lighter ale, not very bitter. Then tried the Stiegl Gold Lager ($9.75) which was probably my preferred out of the 2. Very easy to drink as with most lagers and made for a nice contrast to the comparatively stronger ale. For food, I went with the bistro mac and cheese ($23) which overall was nice, but a bit small. Plenty of chicken, cheese and breadcrumbs to go around, filling but simply because its a pretty \"heavy\" dish. Would\\'ve liked a bit less cheese with a bit more everything else.

I opted for thai as I wanted something really tasty.  It did not disappoint.  Most of all, the portion was generous, which surprised me and made me think that I was in the USA for a moment. The veal chop that I mentioned before was also a huge portion with gnocchi and peppers.  The server didn't ask how I liked it cooked, so I thought perhaps there's no choices when it comes to cooking veal lol.  When it came to me, I thought it looked an bit well done, but as I tasted it, I was surprised at how it was juicy.  My friend said the same for the ribs. For dessert, I tried the blueberry bread pudding with ice-cream.  The ice-cream had a rough texture and it was very mild in taste.  The bread pudding was only ok.

The good: Aburi style sushi! Any of the torches pressed sushi: oishi! The signature rolls, the creamy udon. I wasn't expecting much from Udon but it was worth a trip or 7. The torched pressed sushi though: worth like 10-12 trips alone for that. Tried their surf and turf roll as well. I thought that was a ok. On a pricier side and a ok. Aburi sushi though, can't go wrong. They are also extremely busy. Make reservation! I got in easy first time around the last trip: I ended up waiting almost an hour for counter: bar seat for 1!

I didn't enjoy it as much as we were seated right beside where the servers pass regularly to go into the kitchen, the ambiance killed it for me as well as how long it took to get each course when others were getting it right away. Our bill came up to $420 minus tip. Imo, if I'm paying that much, the service and ambiance should be to the T. I appreciate those things in a restaurant almost as equally as the food. I've had better experiences in places that are 1/4th of the price. I'm sure we got unlucky with the seating and given its Valentines Day and all... which was a bummer for us.\",\n",

We ended with the cheese tart which I was skeptical of (not a fan of grapes and it had blue cheese shavings on it), but not only was it absolutely beautiful the taste was beyond wonderful.

The single-items were still a bit too much for one person. The platter for 2 was massive, we split between 3 of us and still had leftovers. Cauliflower soup was a bit whatever, tasted like chicken noodle, but replace chicken with cauliflower. Still tasty though! A nice appetizer. The schnitzels were wonderful and not tough at all, super tender. My favorite is the cabbage rolls, the filling is to die for (they actually have the filling as a side \"sauce\" lol). The platter came with your choice/mix of potato + cheese or sauerkraut, both were good but not particularly stand-out items in the platter. All the salads, on the other hand, were perfection!

We dropped in on a Friday evening (with 7:00pm reservations). The inside was busy but didn't feel squished as tables are well spaced out. The sidewalk seating (shaded with umbrellas) was packed. Our server was friendly but we weren't checked on once it got lively. The menu is two pages but with a plethora of options; starters, salads, soups, sandwiches, Polish classics, Polonez signatures, schnitzels, combo plates and desserts. - Chlodnik ($8.95) - came with a side of potatoes; cold and bland. I had a taste and the cold borscht was fantastic. Our Polish friend said it reminded him of his grandma's cooking. - Flaczki ($7.95) - first time trying this and it was so satisfying. Tripe was incredibly tender and the broth was pure bliss. Came with a pile of rye bread. - Platter for 1 ($24.95) - the boiled pierogis were heavenly with a great bite. The bigos was super flavourful with sauerkraut, sausage, pork and mushrooms. Schnitzel was a generous portion topped with mushrooms. Nicely breaded and pounded thin. The beet and cabbage helped to balance things off. - Cabbage roll ($4.95) - we opted for the pork. Decent but standard fare. - Pulpety ($20.95) - the 6 chicken balls were massive, tender and the sauce really dilly. Plate came with potatoes, carrots, beets and cabbage. You can easily share this plate between a couple. I'd come back to CP in a heartbeat. Great portions and delicious Polish comfort food. 4.5 stars.\",\n",

We were here as a party of four following a nice hike with friends around Bloor West Village and High Park. This was late summer in 2019 before COVID spun the world upside down so, for what it's worth, I can at least say that I would definitely come back next time I'm down in the Roncy neighbourhood. I can see that prices have definitely increased, which wouldn't have been a surprise even without COVID and the resulting havoc it wreaked on staffing. My husband and I both ordered a pork schnitzel plate, with potatoes and salad. The schnitzels were very well cooked and not greasy. The potatoes and salad were fresh and well prepared. Another of our party had the roast chicken plate and reported she was very happy with the taste, texture and temperature of her chicken, as we were with the potatoes and salad as well. These dishes did not come with any extras the way some other specials do, so no gravy or sour cream unless you add it on at menu cost. Our other friend went for a vegetarian option and an order of potato pancakes (which in this case did include sour cream, but nothing else.) The restaurant has a wonderful, warm atmosphere with proper wooden tables and chairs, lovely, large front window for light, yet cozy with no glaring light inside. The setup is nice and not bunched up, so going to the bathrooms (which were clean and tidy) didn't require bumping around other diners along the way.

A mouthful of garlicky umami, the splash of Tabasco  was perhaps a bit more heavy-handed this visit so there was a noticeable kick to the salad. The bacon was still served in chunks, a bit too hard for me. I wish they'd change this to strips so it's crunchier... they could even place a strip on top (like the sliver of anchovy) as a garnish. Making the croutons from leftover cheese buns, rather than regular bread, could bring the salad to new heights. Thankfully, no low-carb vegan diet has influenced Jacobs, their cheese buns still make an appearance. One of the highlights of the meal, it's really a Yorkshire pudding with cheese, slather on butter and these are perfection. Remembering how tasty the T-bone steak looked previously, we substituted our typical rib eye order with their Guelph prime Hereford bone-in T-bone ($175), a hefty 25oz (when including the bone) and was more than enough to share amongst two. While not as marbled as my beloved ribeye, it's a great cut for contrast as you receive a piece of tenderloin and striploin. Both are leaner cuts: the striploin full-flavoured and tenderloin swoon-worthy as it's soft and juicy. The steak's crust was flawless and the seasoning perfectly. For those who find it needs more salt, complimentary condiments - a bacon blue cheese spread, shoyu, chimichurri, and selection of salts - are available. Amongst our table of ten, we shared five side dishes, and it was more than enough. Go to Gastro World for the details of the 5 sides.\",\n",

I'm always surprised that so many people have this type of money to spend on dinner, but it was busy so there is no shortage of clientele. My friend and I decided to treat ourselves as moderately as possible here.  The waiter likely sensed this and was very helpful in keeping us within a somewhat high but reasonable budget for this steakhouse.  Service was nothing less than polite and perfect. Surprisingly, a lot of the menu is shareable.  The tableside caesar salad could be split as could most of the sides.  We splurged a bit and got two different steaks.  We left feeling fuller than I was expecting and happy with our experience. I don't have the type of disposable income to make this my new Friday spot.

Excellence perspires through every plate that comes out of that kitchen, and the attention to detail is immaculate. They start you off with their warm bread and butter. The bread is fluffy and crusty all at once, with a lovely herby butter that is dangerously good. Some of the best bread and butter I've ever had, and you're off to a good start. The apps are great across the board, but there's nothing better than the caesar salad. It is bar none, the best salad I have ever had in my life, perfectly dressed and with a mouth-watering combination of textures and flavours in every bite. The seafood is also very good, I especially enjoy their oysters and jumbo shrimp, which are absolutely massive. At this point it's hard not to be full, but the meat is the main event. I recommend getting one of the bigger lower grade steaks to fill up on, with an Aussie wagyu and a Japanese wagyu to taste. The Japanese wagyu is like eating butter, it just melts on your tongue. The Aussie wagyu is my favourite - slightly less fatty but with immense character in the flavours. As for the rest of the steaks, they're all solid, but one bite of the wagyu and it's hard to go back to the regular stuff. When it comes to dessert, everything is solid but not mind blowing. They send you home with a chocolate chip muffin which I usually like to save for breakfast, and it's easily the best muffin I've had in my life. Overall, this place is definitely worth it - it is easily one of the best steakhouses / meals I've had in my life, and consistently blows me away every time I try it.\",\n",
              " \"My post-pandemic birthday celebration was top notch. When you approach the building, it's a bit hidden. Behind these taller than lifesize double doors, you descend down a flight of steps. Your eyes squint in the dimly lit entrance as you're asked about your reservations, valet, and coat check by a line of ladies. Once checked in, you're led through the 3 compartment labyrinth starting with the piano lounge (chill and for groups), up a stairs to another busy (family/groups) section including a bar (single seats), and then finally to the romantic (2 person or 4 persons table) section. Along the way to the romantic zone, you walk by this giant fridge full of these impressive cuts of meat. All I remember was that they were meaty and juicy, and humungous. Server then comes with menus and introduces the steak menu, and the fact that you can order half portions of the sides. We had a look at the menu beforehand so had a rough idea of narrowing down our choice of steak. The steak menu is vast with steaks ranging from $100 to just under a cool $1,000. But if you think that was impressive enough, you haven't looked at the wine menu. Hundreds and hundreds of different wines. We ordered a shareable steak, the Caesar salad (which is a fun little show where they make it infront of you), a few JUMBO shrimps (seriously, the biggest shrimps I've ever seen), and the mash potato and mushroom sides. The steak was succulent and perfectly cooked. The sides were a bit underwhelming and the cocktail I ordered wasn't that spectacular. Moving to desserts, we had the flourless chocolate cake with mint ice cream and loved it. Thought the mint ice cream was similar to Bang Bang on Ossington. Service was attentive, but we noticed that we didn't get the full explanation of how the meal was cooked like how the other tables did. They fold your napkins for you when you're in the washroom which is nice. They did light a candle on my dessert and wished me a happy birthday but no comp on the dessert, which is fine. Price: expect to pay $150+ per person but the sky is the limit. Overall, definitely an experience and wish we asked to be seated near the piano -next time!

Another thing was when our server was trying to take an extra place setting away, instead of taking one item at a time, he asked for us to hand him everything on the placemat, which had fork, knives, glass, plates etc. and as I expected everything fell on me... lol...luckily no sharp steak knife. The Cesar salad is still one of my faves. The foie gras looked completely burnt on the outside and mushy on the inside, really turned me off. The bone marrow for some reason tasted like uncooked piece of fat even tho it was cooked... really weird never experienced this before. The steaks were not great cuts for over $400/piece. One steak was half fat, and the other was too rare. The bass ceviche was light, I enjoyed this dish. We brought our own cake, the fee was $5/person.

Next were tacos, and in order of excellence they were: - beef: explosive flavours, crunchy taco shell for texture, chunky guac - fish: perfectly crispy and lightly fried, lot of slaw but went nicely with the lime - chicken: meat was pretty good with the crunch shell and guac once again - pastor: meat was just ok but pineapple was great touch Finally, the reason this place gets that 5th star is the churros. This was probably the best churro I've ever had, with unreal textures of light crispness on the outside and soft doughy inside.

Our first round of skewers aren\\'t hot enough and don\\'t have the hints of charcoal smell. From second round and on, it\\'s back to their usual high quality.

If you've never had uni it's very creamy and provides a delicious seafood flavour to the udon. Definite must try. Also highly recommend the Zakkushi skewer set and the chicken karaage. The skewers all have a smoky flavour from the wood fire grill they are grilled on. Each skewer is also so different that it provides a refreshing change of pace and interesting insight into Japanese flavours. The chicken karaage is also fried to perfection with a very crispy skin. It is perfectly paired with a creamy mayo sauce that adds another dimension of texture and flavour. Also would recommend trying out the unique Japanese cocktails and beers that go great with the small bites. The okinomiyaki is very nice if you've never had it before but is much smaller than you think. This place is a great place for drinking and having a small meal. If you're trying to get full it might get a bit pricey as you will have to order more plates.

For the price, we would not get it again but it was definitely juicy and well marbled beef. Next time, I'd like to try the grilled fish as it seemed quite popular. The ambiance is that of a typical Izakaya and you can watch the kitchen grill your food on a charcoal grill from certain tables.  Our waitress was super sweet and attentive. Couldn't have asked for a better Japanese Izakaya experience short of booking a flight to Japan.\",\n",

Service was good but I have had better at other fine dining establishments. Portions were very small, but I did not come ravenously hungry, so I was satisfied and happy by the end of the meal. Hamachi sashimi - divine. Sitting atop some very flavourful oils. Foie gras tart with strawberry gelé and crème fraîche - super different and interesting, but way too rich Rice - very creamy and buttery, the crispy rice on top adds great texture and grapefruit pulp adds a refreshing tang Scallop and mussel in foam - a perfectly seared scallop is the way to my heart Steak - not a steak lover but even I thought this was great. Eggplant tempura on the side. Bread - very rich and oily bread. Adding butter on top seemed like overkill. Came warm. Dessert - a delicate and light peach cake, passion fruit caramel, canelé, strawberry jelly, and a birthday dulce de leche dessert with candle (not pictured). Although this meal stretched my budget, it was an adventure in food and well worth it for a special occasion.',\n",
              " \"With all the hype that Alo gets, my expectations were pretty high coming in for a New Year's Eve tasting menu. We were seated in the bar room, which wasn't very spacious, but had a nice moody aura. Though Alo is labelled as a French restaurant, our seven course meal was surprisingly Japanese, with components like bluefin tuna sashimi, sake kasu, and maitake mushrooms. My favourite courses were the koshihikari rice white truffle risotto and the east coast scallop topped with caviar. Flavours of each dish were well balanced in every course, tasting best with all elements in one bite. Service was great throughout the evening. My friend didn't like the foie gras (our second course), and the waiter promptly replaced it with a citrus-y beet salad. We appreciated that they were well prepared for such a scenario, especially with how rich the foie gras is. Fresh cutlery was provided with every course, with the waitstaff clearing the table in sync. I was content with my experience, and I do think Alo deserves their star, but with a price point of $250pp, I wasn't entirely blown away. You are also required to pay the full amount upon booking. I'd love to come back in the future to see if the dining room experience is different.\",\n",
              " 'As I recount my latest experience at Alo, I grapple with the final mark: would I still consider them a 9 or a \"top pick\"? There were dishes that were incredible, but then some that missed the mark. The tasting menu ($225 per person) was off to a shaky start when the canapés arrived. We\\'re instructed to eat the four bites in a particular order. The first, an oyster with compressed cantaloupe and Iberico ham oil had a fishy essence without an acidic element (like the traditional mignonette or lemon) to help cut through the strong taste. It also seemed off that it wasn\\'t ice cold for something that should be served uber fresh. The first bite was a bust. Slowly, the redemption started with the beautifully presented uni tart, which was made even creamier with a thick crème fraiche on the bottom. While this wasn\\'t mind-blowing, it was at least not repulsive. After the fishy oyster I had doubts about the mackerel tart, but this was unfounded as the meaty fish was very clean tasting and well balanced with bright pops of the daintiest tomatoes and fruit. Indeed, there was an ocean-like essence from the caviar, but it wasn\\'t overpowering. The canapés ended with a foie gras and strawberry jelly tart that created a sweet and savoury element. This was surprisingly good and wonderfully rich. It\\'s unclear if Alo is pandering to Michelin inspectors as the procession of Japanese dishes just seem out of place at a French restaurant. Sure, I can understand if they want to throw in one dish that\\'s has a Japanese influence, but to feature a handful was just too much. Moreover, some dishes just can\\'t live up to what you\\'d be served during an omakase meal. Chef Patrick Kriss should drop the madai course, a sea bream paired with chili oil, caviar, and kumquat. Like the oyster, it was fishy and warm. Give me this fish cool with freshly grated wasabi and soy sauce any day. The kinmedai was better, the red snapper was at least cold and refreshing with the oh so finely julienned radish in the centre. The various oils complimented the fish nicely and this was an improvement over the other sashimi course. If Alo must have a sashimi course (why would it), one is enough. Having a soft spot for chawanmushi I wouldn\\'t be opposed to this remaining on the menu. The actual steamed egg was hot and silky, but then enhanced with lovely French and Western elements: smooth foie gras tofu cubes, fragrant truffle paste, crunchy radish, sweet corn, and crispy chicken skin. All this amongst a pool of reduced capon broth. What an incredible dish! This is a long review, head to Gastro World for the rest.',\n",

I communicated with this restaurant several months in advance and made sure they could accommodate my wife's dietary restrictions for her birthday celebration. They explained they could not modify the menu in their main dining room, but would if we sat in the bar area. Considering the high quality of being a Michelin restaurant, I readily accepted. We both loved our experience. They saved a special corner table (# 26) for us, overlooking the rest of the bar area. Food was a 5-course menu for $120 ea. Drinks were an additional $189, for a total of $429 CAD. Joy, our server took great care of us. Food was exquisite.  We would love to return.\",\n",

Excellent food The whole menu and Each dish was well balanced well thought out. The menu did introduce me to different flavours and combination that will get me thinking about again and again! Service Impeccable service - the best service I had. It was the little things that makes this an amazing experience Our reservation was at 915 pm and we were seated promptly. We didn't finish until 12am so it was quite a long dining experience. Couple of dishes that didn't really wow me for example we had a pasta dish, and desserts was ok (although it introduced me to canelés and I'm obsessed). Expect your wallet to hurt. We ordered 2 glasses of wine and added truffles to one of our meals. That was almost an additional of $150. This is definitely a restaurant worth visiting and experiencing. Great for occasions. Highly recommend this to anyone who can obtain a reservation!\",\n",

The canapes, Hokkaido Scallop, Shima Aji, Wagu & Oyster, East Coast Lobster, Japanese A5 wagyu, Lemongrass & Limquat were all exquisite! Alo definetely has the most unique and unbeatable flavor. However, the pasta dish was not up to my expectations and failed to impress me. But let me tell you about the Japanese A5 Wagyu - it was simply divine! The meat melted in my mouth, and I finally understood what Gordon Ramsay meant by saying how steaks would melt in his mouth. It was so much better than any other steak I've had. Although it did get too fatty in some bites, to the point where I chugged my entire mocktail, I didn't notice the wasabi at first, but once I did, it changed the taste in the most delightful way. As for the Lemongrass & Limequat, it was refreshing and light, and I simply adored it. The Mont Blanc Petit fours were a little too sweet for my taste, but the coffee balanced it out. I especially loved the box that came with the dessert; I wanted to take it home with me! I must commend the waitstaff; they were all lovely and made my dining experience even more delightful. All in all, I truly enjoyed my time here and can't wait to come back!\",\n",
              " \"This place has been on my list for years, it was definitely worth the wait. My boyfriend and I went with the full tasting menu and got a cocktail each with our meals. Here are my thoughts on the courses: 0. Canapés - love the presentation and taste of every bit. It was a great balance of unique flavours, mostly savoury and creamy. My favourite bite was the smoked salmon with caviar. The tart crust was so crispy, the salmon was very fresh and the caviar was a great pop of flavour. 1. Hokkaido Scallop - these were the best scallops I've had! Super fresh with a hint of sweetness. The zesty sauce was a great compliment. 2. Wagyu & Oyster - one of my favourite bites of the night. The wagyu was so buttery. I usually don't enjoy raw oyster, but this was very fresh. The 2 purées were refreshing and light. Excellent balance to the buttery wagyu. 3. Shima-aji - these sashimi slices were so fresh. The spot of yuzu really brought out the natural flavour of the fish. 4. East Coast Lobster - thoroughly enjoyed this dish as well. The lobster was springy and sweet. The uni was very creamy with a light salty flavour. The egg based sauce added to the creaminess of the dish. This was a very filling and comforting dish. 5. Koshihikari Rice - this dish resembled a risotto. Loved the mushrooms used. The rice itself was slightly on the saltier side. 6. Swordfish - very unique chewy texture. Loved the flavour of the spicy peppers and sauce. 7. Pecking duck - very tender and flavourful. The purée was an amazing complement to the meaty flavour of the duck. Be sure to eat them together! 8. Provimi Veal Tenderloin - this tasted so much better than it looked. It was one of the most tender steaks I've had. The light salt brings out the natural flavour of the meat. Don't skip out on the eggplant purée! It was an excellent complement to the veal if you wanted a stronger smoky flavour. I should also shoutout the butter milk bread, so soft and buttery! 9. Dessert 1 - love the chestnut praline topping. Inside the chocolate dome contained ice cream and meringue. A delightful dessert with many textures and flavours. 10. Petit Fours - contained yuzu Madeline, chocolate tart. Chocolate rum Choux, and Canelé. This was my first time having Canelé and I absolutely loved it! Overall one of the best dining experiences I've had! The waiter and all the staff were super attentive and friendly. Definitely worth the price :)\",\n",

Luckily I was able to get one, but they do get filled up quick! I made the reservation over Tock about 2 months in advance. Right when we walked in we were greeted at the elevator and they asked if we wanted our coats taken. We were taken to our seats and asked if we wanted any champagne before the meal. We were also asked if we were interested in any upgrades/additions to our meal including a wine pairing. Our meal was 11 courses with the option to add an additional course. There were 2 wine pairings to choose from, a regular and premium one. We opted to have one regular pairing and share as we're not much of wine drinkers. During the meal they started off every course with a brief explanation of the dish. If there was a wine pairing for the course the wine would come first with an explanation as well. In between courses our utensils were changed as well. All the courses were really good. We especially loved the lobster and swordfish courses. For dessert we were given an additional small cake as we were celebrating a birthday. After our meal was finished we were given our menu for the night as well as our wine pairings. The service and food was excellent throughout the whole night.\",\n",

I love the vibe here, most seatings are booths (very tiny ones, so it's great for 2 but super tight for 4 people) but the set up looks like a pub in Japan! The servers were also very attentive as well! My bf and I decided to try their Aburi sushi, Gyu tataki (lightly seared beef) , beef tenderloin skewers, pork neck skewers and oysters karaage. Overall, I found the prices to be a little steep as all the dishes were average and nothing to run home about. My least favourite being their Gyu tataki. Pretty much flavourless. The only flavour came from the onions that the beef was sitting on, but the meat itself had no flavour. 2/5. My favourite would be their oysters karaage, the batter was a bit too thick for my liking however, the flavours were good especially when mixed in with their house made mayo. 3.5/5 The polar beer float was definitely the highlight for me, it was Sapporo topped with a swirl of icy beer. Very unique, very delicious, can't go wrong with Sapporo! Probably won't get this every time, because at the end of the day it still just taste like a regular Sapporo... just colder. But I think it was worth the experience. 5/5 Overall, come here for a chill date with friends for their drinks and the vibe but don't expect much from their food.\",\n",

The water pump was interesting, at least I had it on my table where you can pump your own water. No need to ask for a server (unless you ran out of water in that pitcher). Tsukune - Nope. Beef was overcooked for my liking. Maguro Tataki - Love it! Lightly seared properly. Ika Yaki - Love it! There's that strong ika taste that tasted with the food. Japango Roll - Love it! I'm a sucker for aburi rolls. 3 kinds sashimi - I got salmon, tuna, and torched butterfish for my 3 kinds. It was good overall. Oden soup - Meh. Nothing special. Service was good here.

We had - Chicken Karaage - Deep fried Soft Shell crab - Beef tataki - Sashimi (Salmon & Hamachi) - Beef tongue skewer With Asahi Superdry, warm sake, and a few cocktails. Their deep-fried foods were good though the Karaage was a bit dry, with a lot of small pieces. Soft shell crabs had good meaty parts, and I liked them. The beef tataki was ok but the sauce was mysteriously sweet - I expected that tataki to come with sauce with a hint of sourness. I found the sashimi pieces were too thick, ignoring each fish\\'s unique delicacy. I did not like their presentation of sashimi with \"thicker the better\" thinking. I expected that each fish be cut at an appropriate thickness to maximize the unique character, and the hamachi could be better if it was thinner with more slices. But I should not expect such delicacy in this casual Izakaya-like place. I wanted the Asahi to be served chillier. It lost hoppiness and crispness when it was served. Their warm sake was not served at the appropriate temperature - under-warmed, and losing the alcohol punch.

This was the perfect amount of food, we struggled to finish the last piece. If I was very hungry I could've taken down the sashimi platter myself but I wasn't feeling heroic tonight. The restaurant serves two different types of soy sauces for the sushi. One specifically for the red fish and the other for all others. In the middle was flaked salt, I didn't catch what that was for, probably the wagyu? Wifey ate all hers and helped herself to mine. For drinks I enjoyed the two Japanese whiskey's who's names escape me but wifey really enjoyed her beverage, Sakura. Lychee, blueberries, and alcohol, what else could you ask for?

Everything was beautifully presented, carrying the clean yet elegant decor of the space onto the food. The chawanmushi was steamed flawlessly with the flavors of the uni and kura coming through. It was small yet filling. The pressed sushi though was the highlight. Each bite of melt in your mouth deliciousness made me want to order more even though  I was full. No soy sauce or extras needed. I did trade one of my jabistrolls for one of my friend's hotate since I love scallops. I think my favorite was the wagyu since I'm addicted to anything with yakiniku sauce and the beef was like butter.

The broth felt oily/fatty in a non-pleasant way, where it coated the inside of my mouth and felt like it stuck to my lips if licked them. The flavour itself was very nice, but it was the feeling of it that I found a bit unpleasant. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth delicious though! Definitely recommend getting the premium toppings to get extra pork and a delicious ramen egg. One thing I thought was odd was the noodles--they feel like a thin egg noodle vs. a ticker ramen noodle.

The fried dumpling base is like a fluffy biscuit topped with a mound of creamy ackee and saltfish spread studded with sweet peppers, onions, and tomatoes. It reminds me of a more fluid crab cake with a pop of freshness. The pepper shrimp ($19) still knocked a fiery punch bringing on the scotch bonnet zing while swimming in garlic butter. The sauce seemed much thicker, so it really sticks to the seafood or acts as a dip for the crunchy bread. I wish the kitchen had served the mixed green and mango salad ($17) with the shrimp (instead of with the mains) as it had a refreshing coolness that would have helped tame the spicy shrimp. Ultimately, it's a salad, which was light on the mango but had some tropical flair from toasted coconut chips. Oddly, the jerk pork ($24) was completely devoid of the spice and heat you'd expect and tasted like regular barbeque meat. If anything, my favourite part of the dish was the sauteed greens made from kale, collard greens, cherry tomato, and onion. It's a side that would go great with anything. As with the previous visit, Chubby's saucier dishes continue to impress. While I would have liked more heat in the curry chicken ($19), it was nonetheless tender and flavourful, pairing well with the jasmine rice and pineapple chutney. The gravy from the oxtail stew ($25) was also on point, and pairs well with side dishes like the rice and peas and as a dip for the fried okra ($11). The oxtail was a tad scant on the meat, but what was included was flavourful and tender. I could easily have an entire order of this to myself. Chubby's smartly leaves the fried plantain ($10.50) in large chunks, so they don't dry out. They were the best plantains I've ever had, a slight crispiness outside yielding to the soft fruit, with a sprinkling of salt that enhanced its semi-sweetness. In fact, with a scoop of coconut ice cream and a caramel drizzle, the fried plantains could even sub in for dessert. Consequently, much tastier than the cornmeal pudding ($12), which was too salty and had a non-existent 'pudding' element. If anything, the dessert was merely a piece of corn bread covered with fussy corn nuts and a scoop of mellow coconut sorbet.\",\n",

The coleslaw on the side tasted very vinegary, there were 3 of us that had it and all of us struggled to finish it... My friend had the goat curry and there was a lot more bone than goat. We also got a side of rice with peas and it was a little dry. The better items on the menu were the jerk wings (the cornbread being the star of that dish), and the fried plantain. I don't know how my friend's drinks were, but I got the Havana Nights cocktail. It was strong but I would have liked a dash of sweetness in there for variety as the flavours in there are mostly bitter with a bit of sour. Service was a little slow, we had to ask to get our water refilled.\",\n",

They had plenty of tables, but looked to be reserved by multiple large parties and the night continued. I would recommend booking a table as it does get busy. Our server was friendly and helpful, recommending oxtail stew over the curry goat while my partner ordered the small jerk chicken. Great flavors for both with the appropriate spice levels. Only complaint is that the portions are 1/3 of what I'm use to in the suburbs at almost double the price. However, given the King West location that is to be expected.

              " \"We tried out this resto in First Canadian Place for their happy hour 2-5 pm daily and boy are we glad we did. They have a really great menu in general, but during happy hour, you can do really wonderfully (price wise) on drinks, wine, some of their specialties, including their steak/frites. We had a couple of cocktails, their salmon Anura appetizer (soooo good) and then the Jerk Chi Ken and Steak Frites.  Our waitress Vienna was fabulous and the food and vibe was excellent. If you're looking in that area for a nice meal do check them out. Easy to get to via TTC.\",\n",

First and foremost, they have happy hour everyday from 2pm-5pm (at the Ontario location) Now for those who work during those hours, it might not be appealing, but because I was on vacation, it was superb for my friends and I. We sat on the rooftop and loved every minute of it; Such a vibey ambiance. Our server was super accommodating and kind in her approach and could address pretty much any question or concern we had.  I am a mezcal girl through and through so of course I had to try the mezcal margarita and I had more than one. My best friend and I shared the prawn crunch roll, mini crispy chicken sandwiches and a couple other dishes because why not (it is happy hour after all!) and every single dish was amazing. Overall, my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience and would definitely recommend it to everyone!',\n",

The hostess was kind and seated me but also informed me they needed the high top table back in the bar area by a certain time, which was fine, but it seemed a little strange. I thought I would have lots of time, but the service was quite slow as I waited forever to be served. Finally someone checked in on me and took my order. I asked if they could sub arugula for their kale salad and they said they would check, but never got back to me. A long while later, I was served my food with the arugula salad, great I thought. A longer while later, a server checked on me, and I advised them I was still missing my drink order. After finishing my meal and getting my bill, I noticed they charged me an extra $4 for the arugula substitute, which was disappointing, but it is what it is.\",\n",

When it first opened it was crazy busy and you had to make reservations 2 weeks in advanced. Now that there are several new restaurants opened in the area it has slow down.  Except in the evenings when business people  come for after work drinks.  This is my first review. Of all my experience I would give Cactus Club Cafe a 4 star.  The service is always consistent.  A few favourite appetizers I've tried is the calamari, good and tasty. Chicken wings are small and dry.  The shrimp ravioli is amazing. Lettuce wrap is also great! I've tried most of the main dishes.  The short ribs pappardelle with arugula is great.  This was the dish in the picture attached.  I love their specials. I had the pineapple and hoisin beef short Ribs with with snow peas and mash potatoes.  It's was amazing a must have. Their spicy chicken sandwich is great, salmon is great. Also I had their duck sandwich it was amazing. All in all great experience here.\",\n",

But the urban music was great! They were playing a good mash up of popular hits. Our waiter was so pleasant, and helpful. We had plenty of drinks. The Bellini was a popular choice if you like sweet drinks. As for food; the tacos were a favorite amongst our table. I found the tacos to be over battered, but that's a personal preference. The hot fried chicken and vegetarian sushi was good, the steak was great. (These are all comments made by those that ordered.) And my kids like their burgers. The fries were a little over cooked for their liking. I think if the food was amazing it would have been better.\",\n",

My boyfriend and I here came here for dinner and decided to share the 45 day aged ribeye, grilled mushroom with cured egg yolk and jamon croqueta. We also decided to order a house cocktail. The dry aged steak was probably one of the steaks I've had! The meat was very tender and savory with a nice hint of smokiness. I also really enjoyed the mushrooms and egg yolk dish. It was super flavorful and the egg yolk added an extra layer of flavour. The croqueta was also creamy on the inside and crispy on the outside.

Due to the streetcar constriction (hope it will finish soon!) , the access was a bit tricky at this time, but in spite of this, the restaurant was FULL of people by 6:30pm (Friday). I am glad I made a reservation. Was a perfect place to catch up with my girlfriend with great food and drinks after busy weekdays. Even though the place was busy - the a dimly lit interior somewhat gave us a sense of privacy. The service was excellent. Our server was very good at giving details about the menu to us, his descriptions/suggestions were so good that I wanted to order almost every dish he mentioned! He was also friendly and attentive. We (two) had the following dishes: Food: Shishito Peppers Sea Bream Ceviche & Chips Grilled Octopus (Quarter) Roast Veal Bone Marrow Drink: Isabel Fashioned ¡Rebujito! And some draft beer and local craft beers. Impressed by the Roast Veal Bone Marrow. The melty bone marrow came with toasted multigrain sourdough & refreshing Parsley Verde & good quality sea salt. Each item was simple, but eating together - soooo good! Loved this. The grilled octopus was excellent as well. Tender, perfectly seasoned, and goes very well with butter sauce with a hint of sourness. Eating with the sautéed dandelion underneath the octopus gives another layer of flavor (nice bitterness). Enjoyed this, thank you!!! The shishito was nicely seasoned, fried perfectly leaving the plumpness/crispiness of the peppers. They weren't too pungent or overly salty at all. I loved the shaved salt sprinkled around the peppers. Sea Bream Ceviche was the least favorite food of the night, but they are still good. Just felt that it is not worth the price. Will come back for sure, this is a place for the well executed food and excellent service!\",\n",

But this time I made sure to call in advance and reserve an order, which ended up being the very last one of the night. Grilled Mushrooms & Cured Egg Yolk: This was pretty good, the egg yolk had a bit of rich/saltiness and the mushrooms were grilled nicely Quarter Octopus: This just ended up being 1.5 tentacles (about 6 pieces of octopus) and was $32 :/ Roast Veal Bone Marrow: Can't really go wrong with this accompanied with a side of tangy chimmichuri sauce Cured Chorizo (?): Buttery and full of flavor, one of my favorite cuts of cured meat Foie Gras with Peaches: This was really tasty, the peaches were sweet and caramalized and the foie gras was slightly salty, rich and buttery. The food is pretty much the same as before except the prices are higher cause inflation. I also noticed resos aren't as hard to snag as they used to be which is a plus, and walk ins generally have zero wait time now. For a very casual dinner, it was over $200 including 1 alcoholic beverage. I honestly find it quite steep now for some items\",\n",

The staff knew their menu well and have good recommendations when it comes to which drink goes well with what dish. We ordered the deluxe bento box which is like a sampler set of nine dishes, the nigiri special, the tiger prawn tartare, the beef tongue, a bottle of sake, yuzu G&T, Moscow mule, and the Doraemon drink. 1) Bento Box I don't remember which dishes came in the set but I really enjoyed the ebi mayo the most. I believe it also came with karaage, salmon, beef, corn, and others. There's enough food to share with another person as well. 2) Nigiri Special The fish they used is from Taro Fish. Not much to say except for it being fresh. The Nigiri already has wasabi added to it so it doesn't come with any on the side. The tuna tataki bowl was also pretty good. 3) Tiger Prawn Tartare The dish comes with garlic toast and the tartare is mixed with avocado. It was quite lovely and I enjoyed the garlic toast. 4) Beef Tongue I've never really tried this before and it was unexpected. I did find the meat to be slightly salty but the sauce it came with complements the beef tongue well. 5) Drinks The bottle of sake we ordered was recommended by the staff as it pairs well with the fish on their nigiri plate. The cocktails were regular but I liked the yuzu g&t the most. The food is what you'd expect from an izakaya and a bit on the pricier side too. But I would come back and try their noodles next time since I didn't get the chance to. The service was good, the food came pretty quickly and the server was attentive.\",\n",
              " \"This place is so cute, and I can't wait to come back! I just wish it wasn't situated in a quieter part of town because I'm so used to downtown core. But I'll trek out to come here again. Really nice and cozy vibes, great to meet friends or for a date. My friend and I really came here for the bento after seeing it on IG multiple times. It was a really nice and tasty experience seeing what each block was/contained and then trying it. Each part was delicious and it was like a mini omakase experience but definitely without the $$$ price tag (it was $35). I had some friends comment on my IG story about how it looks like places you'd find in Vancouver! Their bento does change, so I would definitely go back We also ordered an eel roll which I don't remember the name now. It was really delicious but there was some type of leaf in the roll that my friend and I both didn't like -- the taste was quite overpowering unfortunately. I did see the tables around us also order the bento box in addition to actually getting some grilled products so I'd love to come back and try to grill things. This is one place I'd actively go back to Cabbagetown for!\",\n",
              " \"An amazing izakaya that really focuses on great food with fresh ingredients. The beer and cocktail menu has a lot of variety and I liked that they had creative non-alcoholic cocktails too. I'm very sad to see they are closing for renovations and rebranding on Nov 1, but have faith that the management will re-open with something wonderful with a bit of Kingyo's old charm. If you want to enjoy the original Kingyo menu, better book a table ASAP. There's a 2 hour eating limit. So you can't stay here all night but that's good news for waiting list people to know tables will open up at regular intervals. The vibe is very chill and the servers are so friendly. We ordered a lot of food and she paced everything so well. The next wave of dishes came out only when we were done what was in front of us. We started with the hot stone beef tongue. I love tabletop cooking and the beef was sliced nice and thin. The stone's temperature was enough to slightly sear and cook it tenderly without turning it rubbery. The server was happy to bring another stone if it got too cold to continue cooking. Pressed sushi came next. Saba is my favorite fish and the sushi portion here was very meaty! The rice was just the right amount. Spicy Toro was ok. I think the spicy sauce overpowered the tuna and I couldn't taste much else. It's the one thing I probably would not order again. The Makunouchi bento is very popular and one of their signature menu items. Lots of little dishes to sample a variety of traditional Japanese flavors. This on its own is good for just snacking on while drinking with your buddies. My favorites were the miso glazed grill fish, fried ebi, and deep fried tofu nuggets. It's possible the dishes in the box differ from the printout, and your server will tell you in advance what was substituted. Our chirashi came last and at this point I was happy they were mini! Topped with fresh seafood and beautifully presented. I enjoyed what I could but had to ask for a box to eat the rest at home. They surprised us with complimentary ice cream and strawberries as a gift for our anniversary! It was a very nice way to end off the night. For the ladies: their washrooms have complimentary grooming and hygiene items to help you freshen up!\",\n",
              " 'Mini Sea Urchin & Snow Crab Chirashi - Apparenlty I missed the word \"mini\" because when this dish came out I was shocked at how small it was. It was my first time having Uni! Very creamy, but there was a noticable fishy after taste (which my friend said is quite normal). Stone Bowl Eel Unagi Don: one of the best eel rice bowls I\\'ve had! They topped it with egg omelet, takana, dried seaweed, and scallions and it really elevated the dish a made a huge difference in terms of texture and flavour. Kaarage: Really juicy and tender, I enjoyed this, and wish it came with more than 3 pieces! Sushi: we got 4 different types, I honestly don\\'t remember all the names. These were decent but the rice wasn\\'t packed tight enough as it kept breaking when we tried to pick it up. The fish was on the softer and fishier side then I prefer. Kingyo has recently announced they will be restructuring their restaurant and menu starting November 1st so you can look forward to new dishes when they re-open!',\n",
              " \"Yea things have changed since the dine-in days haven't they? Forget about what the server said, how you didn't get your water glass filled right away, now it's all about the FOOD! There's a massive menu on-line where you can buy whole fish, fresh or frozen, etc., but I grabbed a small paper menu from the counter which is accessible inside the restaurant where you will be greeted by a friendly server. I scanned the menu and the (Lunch Only) lined grabbed my attention and it was Beef Fillet Steak Bento, hmmm, that sounded fine at $19. They said to give them 30 minutes at noon on a Friday, so I went for a stroll around Cabbagetown, trying not to stray too far. Right on the dot I was back and my meal was ready, boom! The steak was fantastic! It was great to have a meal like this as a takeaway. The sides were tasty as well, with a tuna salad, chef's dish, and pickles, according to the menu. See my closeup pics for more details. The chef's knife skills made for a gorgeous looking bento box, and the subtle charring of the veg and steak introduced a nice smoky flavour from the hibachi. This place is sooooo good I want to go back again soon and try more items like the Makunouchi Bento $25, or the Kaisen version for $24. Maybe someone out there can point me to other items good for a lunch meal from this menu as everything is reasonably priced and I'm sure will be over the top good!\",\n",
              " \"We went on Monday evening for dinner for two, a couple of months ago. To our surprise, a lot of the Izakayas were closed on Monday. So we decided to venture out to the east end to satisfy our cravings. Atmosphere & Service: There's a bit of construction happening at the restaurant storefront, so we did have a bit of difficulty finding the main entrance around the maze of scaffolding. The restaurant floor area was larger than I had expected. Divided in essentially three different zones - two of which are near the open kitchen. The other is surrounded by vintage Japanese slot machines on the walls. The servers here are friendly and extremely attentive. Food & Taste: We ordered 5 different dishes and created our own mini omakase. Our order: - Kingyo Bento ($35) - Could be a cute order for date night. The bento includes 9 different appetizers ranging from sashimi, fried seafood, steamed egg, grilled fish, beef tartare, etc. I believe the bento changes on a daily basis. - Red Tuna Carpaccio ($9.80) - Full of flavour with complementary sauce and greens. - Stone Grilled Beef Tongue ($14.80) - Very theatrical dish. The dish came with a decent amount of tongue. Personally, I would have preferred the wagyu beef over the beef tongue. Overall great value. - Saba Stick Sushi ($12.80) - One of the best mackerel sushi I have ever had. The cut was extremely thick, but not too overpowering. - Stone Bowl Seafood Sea Urchin Don ($16.80) - Great carb dish to top off your meal. The stone bowl don was loaded with bits of juicy shrimp, scallop and sea urchin. Best bang for your buck. Price: Overall, the dinner amounted to $100, not including tips. For presentation, service, and taste I would say it was extremely worth it. The servers spaced out all our dishes, so the service was pretty much omakase-style. If I am in Cabbagetown, I would stop by again to get the Saba Stick Sushi, Kingyo Bento and the Stone Bowl Seafood Sea Urchin Don.\",\n",

              " 'I ordered the couples platter which is a sampler of many items and the \"trendy\" mazeramen (dry ramen). Couples Platter: - 2 boxes. One with the cold items and one with the hot (fried stuff) - SO MUCH VARIETY... it came with SO MANY SAUCES too! I was surprised. Wish they were labelled so I would have known what they were. I don\\'t think the sauces were even mentioned in the item description. For example, it came with 4 sauces for the sushi... one of them was a ponzu JELLY, and there were at least 2 different kinds of soya sauce. One seemed less salty. The fried box had ketchup for the fries, hot sauce, a mayo that was more vinegary, and a more savory mayo with onion and garlic. I enjoyed them both! It was hard not to make big scoops of the mayo - all in all, everything was yummy and great a combo Trendy mazeramen: - Ive had soupless ramen many times from different places, including the OG that this ramen is trying to copy. It looks good and similar at the surface level, but thats about it. This was TOO dry... just because its soupless doesnt mean it has to be dry with no SAUCE. I think its lacking oil and also flavour - I ended up saving it for later so that I could add my own sauce and additional toppings for flavour (fried mushrooms, onions, hot sauce and sesame oil)',\n",

All their dishes are plated beautifully, and they exhibit the true Japanese-style presentation where each bento box is made up of dozens of high-quality, fresh ingredients and each mini item is crafted to perfection. They pay a lot of attention to detail in terms of presentation and variety in their dishes, especially the bento boxes. The bento boxes are closer to what you'd actually find in Japan (made up of lots of small portions of goodness, and everything is balanced so perfectly - the protein, carbs, veggies - lots of greens!).\",\n",

If you like game and other meats, but want relatively \"classic\" cooking, this is the place to go! I\\'ve only been here a couple times, but really enjoyed it! It\\'s also known to be a great place for a drink - the intimate and cozy setting is quiet and secluded and not too crowded. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointment and to make sure you have enough accommodation. All things aside, prices here are on the high side, so for me, going to Oxley is an absolute treat.

However, the food, despite some efforts at upscale English pub food, falls apart a bit on the execution. The fish and chips plate looked great, but was seriously under-seasoned, and the batter was falling away from the fish. The fries were likewise under-seasoned, and also cut thick and under-fried, creating more of a baked potato effect. The tartar sauce, homemade and in an individual ramekin, was ice cold and rock-hard, likely spooned out in advance of service and left in the fridge. I cut it with a knife! The interior is great, all dark wood and antique furniture. The crowd is on the mature side and they appear to do a brisk after work business. A great pub for a drink and conversation, but the food falls short of its ambitions.\",\n",

I need to mention that their croquetas con champiñones was amazing and was my absolute favorite tapa, although we cleaned all of our plates with everything we ordered.. in fact we ordered extra bread to sop up all of the sauces left behind from the dishes bcuz they were perfectly seasoned. I was a tiny bit disappointed they didn't have the tortilla española and would love to taste their version, but with all of the other delicious dishes we had made up for it. These were tapas well done!\",\n",

Outrageous! please avoid this place, food is not worth this service. by the way, paella was dry and not tasty, octopus was tiny and not good, honestly I don't see a reason to go back there. i hope the owners take some action, managers attitude was embarrassing\",\n",
              " \"Excellent Spanish restaurant on the King West strip. Been there now for around 10 years so it must be good. Its my first visit back in a few years and I was not disappointed. Service was better than ever and the atmosphere was still very cool. We had a bit of everything from wine to cocktails and everything was great. We did tappa's all around and is the best way to enjoy this place. Bone marrow with the beef topper was off the hook. Best dish of the night. Second best dish was the garlic shrimp. So good and flavourful. I loved the sauce i scooped it out with a spoon and put it on my bread. The dishes I was not impressed with. The tomato bread was tasteless. No salt or olive oil. So you have amazing bread and nice tomatoes with great presentation but no seasoning.  This may have been a kitchen mistake I have no idea but not to standard. The chicken liver pate was a bit funky. Something in the dish made it sour either the jam or something to do with the topping threw the dish off. Cheese dishes are a bit disappointing. For almost $50 you get 3 x 1oz slices of cheese and for the most part of the menu this was my least worth it though the cheeses are very good it a premium dish overall. I still think this place is great but they had some off dishes. Be prepared to spend around $100/ person. Thanks for another fun night.\",\n",
              " 'Really enjoyed my recent visit to Patria. Arrived during a very rainy weekday and servers were quick to seat us and promptly set us up with drinks. I came in wet and flustered, but service was not affected. Sometimes, restaurants came be quite pretentious in the area and this was not the case Their version of a gin sour was delicious! Ordered a fee apps, paella is still as good as I remembered it. The stand out tapas for me personally was the fig and machego combo. The flavors just worked really well. The cava prosecco was also ordered. It was ok.',\n",
              " \"3.75/5 Came here for my partner's birthday dinner on a Tuesday night with her brother. Great ambiance and our server was also great. Datiles $16 3/5 I thought this was quite unique so I decided to give it a try after reading the reviews. It came in 5  it was all too sweet for all 3 of us. I liked the profile of it if it wasn't as sweet as jam. Croquetas Setas $14 5/5 This came in 3 so the portion felt a bit small but it tasted fantastic. Very nicely cooked on the outside with a nice creamy, truffle flavor that tasted just right. Beef tartare $16 3.5/5 It looked promising but I found it way too vinegar-y. Seared foie gras $28 5+/5 This was amazing. It was the highlight of the night. The foie gras had an amazing texture that was just right, melted in your mouth, and tasted sublime. The combination of the walnuts and figs added a great texture and taste to the dish as well. Pulpo $23 3/5 This dish didn't make sense to me. The octopus was done well, but the combination with the potatoes just did not go very well. It was also quite bland. Roasted bone marrow $24 3.75/5 It was more of a beef cheek marmalade dish than it was a bone marrow dish. There was not a lot of bone marrow, and the lack of flavor by the bone marrow was compensated with the beef cheek marmalade. Paella patria $70 3/5 This was quite disappointing for a namesake paella (or 'homeland' paella). The seafood was cooked well but the rice just tasted like tomato rice with a tiny bit of salt. The seafood was tasty and on the saltier side so my partner was wondering if they made the rice less salty so you can eat it together. I do agree that the seafood and rice go well together if eaten together but there was too much rice for that. I'm not complaining that there wasn't enough seafood. The rice just lacked flavor. Churros $16 4.75/5 The churros was crispy yet fluffy and the sauce (dulce de leche and coffee chocolate) had the perfect amount of sweetness. I loved the bitterness of the chocolate as well. A bit pricey though. Tres leches $16 4.5/5 This felt sweet but it was quite perfect. It went down so smoothly. Good but also a bit pricey.\",\n",
              " '(3.5) Patria is a new age, cozy Spanish restaurant with a modern twist. Right in the middle of the Fashion/Entertainment district, it has the spark needed to thrive. We came in for the dinner service recently during the weekend. As we were seated, we were given the rundown on cocktails and how the menu is structured. As a predominantly Spanish tapas cuisine, there were many tapas options with entrée and paella options available. Along with a pitcher of sangria, we settled on Pimientos De Padron, Oveja Con Trufa La Quesera, the Beef Tartare, Whole Branzino and the Paella Patria. All in all, all the dishes came out on time and cooked well; nothing really to report on the peppers and the cheese. The beef tartare was fresh and well-seasoned, however there was quite a bit of water/liquid at the bottom of the plate. The dish was also served with some crackers, but there was no where close to being enough for the amount of crackers for the tartare; we used the sourdough that came with the cheese which actually was better suited for the dish in my opinion. The Branzino and Paella came out next - visually it was picturesque and the freshness of the ingredients was apparent. Both dishes were slightly under seasoned, but tasty nonetheless. The Paella looked and tasted great (other than being a bit under seasoned), I think they missed the mark when it came to Socarrat. Typically the tastiest and most fought after part of the dish, our Socarrat was nonexistent. Service was excellent and helpful, will likely return to try other dishes.',\n",
              " \"One of the few spots on King West I frequent, Patria does spanish food incredibly well. Their paella is great and they have a lot of other great classic dishes - especially their meats and cheeses. To be frank, I remember this spot being a bit better pre covid - it was an easy 5 stars for me then - and I still love Patria but it didn't quite blow me away as well as it did before. Here's the rundown of the food: - Croquetas: delicious mushroom croquetas with a truffle relish, I love the texture on these - Crudo: a classic with perfect balance of acidity - Pan Con Tomate: one of my favourites, so simple yet so elegant - Meatballs: these were much better when they were wagyu, but they're still pretty good now - Patatas Bravas: another one of our favourite dishes with lots of egg and a lightly crispy potato - Seafood Paella: loved the scallops especially but I do remember it being seasoned differently when I came here pre-Covid, still pretty good nonetheless Overall I'd say this is a delicious spot to try and I love the vibes here - especially the art with some wonderful paintings on the east side of the restaurant. It's on the pricey side, but worth experiencing at least once.\",\n",
              " \"Happy Saturday everyone! I visited patria last weekend and enjoyed some authentic paella and tapas. We got the following: - Paella Patria: argentinian gulf shrimp, pei mussels, fish, peas, clam, saffron - Croquetas de Setas: porcini mushrooms, manchego cheese, truffle aioli (not pictured because we gobbled it up ) - Gambas: argentinian gulf shrimp, garlic, parsley - Sorpresa Cava Sangria: white wine, raspberry peach liqueur, fresh lime, cranberry, rose cava, tart, citrus, light herbed essence The paella was cooked so perfectly, the shrimp were juicy and plump, along with the fresh seafood and saffron rice it all tied together so well! I just wish the flavour was a bit more bold, again this could just be a personal preference for me and my inner Indian craving spice lolol but definitely recommend it for anyone that likes their dishes on the milder side The croquetas were so yummy with the cheese and mushroom stuffing! We inhaled these so quickly and unfortunately didn't get a picture but we throughly enjoyed them The gambas were my favourite pick out of the tapas, you cannot go wrong with these !!!! They're HUGE, juicy and absolutely delicious Last but certainly NOT the least is the super tasty sopresa sangria, the combination of wine and raspberry peach liqueur worked so perfectly with the garnishes, I almost wish I ordered a jug all to myself lol but maybe next time! Overall we had an awesome experience dining at patria, our server was really nice and had great suggestions! The restaurant has beautiful decor inside with a very warm, cozy atmosphere bustling with people enjoying their meal and having a good time. Thank you for the tasty meal and amazing customer service patria, see you soon! If you're ever downtown or simply looking to have some yummy Spanish tapas do check them out y'all :)\",\n",
              " \"First time visitor from California! Wanted to try a different cuisine than what I normally lean towards. The ambiance is great and service was also good (not overly spectacular but nothing to complain about either). We were hungry after an event and ordered several items to try. 1. Bone marrow app: came out suspiciously fast but didn't mind one bit (at first). The beef cheek shredding on top seemed like a good twist but honestly, it was only OK, slightly dry, and lukewarm. Didn't feel like it added much. It also came with 3 previously toasted slices of bread that were also lukewarm and very thin and stale tasting. Wished we had better toast & more of it to enjoy the marrow. 2. Chicken liver pate app: It had a fruit (?) jelly layer that was set on top. While this is a good idea to cut the richness of the pate, this jelly tasted horrible. It was like cherry cough medicine. Otherwise, the pate itself was good (not amazing). But it was still served with the stale toast. 3. Veggie paella: menu said it would take 45 mins but it was more like 15 mins so that was good! It was fine but again, not amazing. 4. Lamb chops: we ordered the half rack. The waiter said chefs recommended this dish cooked medium well and I had never heard of such a recommendation. It's nearly always medium rare or medium in my experience. This dish didn't taste bad in any way but the flavors were all wrong and I did not enjoy it one bit. WAYY too much going on. The chops had a sherry cumin rub on the outside and sat on top of a pepper sauce. They were then smothered in a chimichurri sauce and lastly coated with loads of sesame seeds. I could barely taste the flavor of the lamb. Also, the menu said they are coated in hazelnut but I guess they only had sesame seeds. I don't prefer sesame seeds and wished the waiter could have at least told us. Overall, I wouldn't come back and can't recommend this place.\",\n",
              " \"We tried the Paella Patria, Paella de la Huerta, mushroom croquettes, and three different types of cheeses (Iberico la Quesera, Oveja con Trufa la Quesera, and 12 Month D.O. Manchego). While all of the food was delicious and reminiscent of authentic Spanish tapas, my favourite dishes were the Paella de la Huerta (vegetarian) and the mushroom croquettes. I also loved the Oveja con Trufa la Quesera (truffle, sheep's milk cheese). If you plan to order paellas, set aside at least 45 minutes to wait for it to cook. Also, the portion sizes are smaller than expected so be prepared to order a few dishes!\",\n",

It kinda reminded me of those Asian jelly cups that I had as a kid. As for the food, we got the Saigon wings which were grilled but they were super crispy and juicy. I love the kick of flavor it had. We also got these deep fried shrimp balls that were also very delicious and I like the sauce it came with. We also got a pork belly dish to share.

The decor is simply magical ! Love the lantern /Asia feel to the restaurant . Some not so positive points- the seats are so uncomfortable. Very hard and hurts the bum:( Table size is also very small and the chairs have no place to hang your purse or put it behind since it is not a full back chair. Unfortunately it was raining that day and we forced to either put our purse on our laps or ground. I tried my friend's chicken in the vermicelli and it was really dry .

My Lantern Dragon cocktail was a but sweet for my taste. I know that\\'s a risk you run with dragon fruit but I couldn\\'t taste any lemongrass at all which is why I ordered the drink. Old Hanoi was \"good as hell.\" The spring rolls held up to the hype -- they were really good and a generous portion. Crispy and very flavorful. 5/5. I wanted to like the coconut clams, and enjoyed the flavor, but it was *super weird* that the dish was basically served at room temperature. I can\\'t imagine that\\'s intentional? Not when it\\'s served in a crock. The pork belly clay pot was bomb. Incredibly tender pork belly - and a lot of it - with the marinated egg, nice pickled veggies to brighten it up, served with rice. Mm! I would happily order that again. Probably regret getting anything else. We were looking forward to the egg salted snails dish but they were out, unfortunately.

The ambience in the restaurant is lovely, with a plethora of frames adorning the walls, unique light fixtures, and elegant furnishings. We ordered the spaghetti alla carbonara and pesce spada (swordfish). The carbonara was tossed in a parmesan wheel right in the center of the restaurant, and tasted pretty good. I was less impressed with the fish, which leaned on the bland side. The gnocchi was the better part of the dish, rather than the protein centerpiece. We got a peach dessert that was on the menu in honour of TIFF, and because it was my partner's birthday, they also brought us a complimentary slice of cassata (ice cream cake with pistachio, rosemary, and rhubarb). Both desserts were delicious. Service here did not disappoint - we really felt well taken care of throughout our meal.

Been wanting to go for a while and I did not regret it when I finally got the chance. They have a wide range of both mocktails and cocktails. If the ones we tried they were all fantastic and fun. Whatever your fancy there is something for everyone. The appetizers were amazing too. House baked breads and calamari. Though I'm not the biggest fan of calamari this has to have been one of the best experiences I've ever had. Tender, salty, and flavourful. Great way to start the meal. The steak was similarly succulent and beautifully plated. Since, we were here and surrounded by cheese wheels we also had to try some pasta. Though the cacio e pepe looked amazing and was being prepared table side the carbonara was calling me. It was so rich and creamy. All the dishes really left me fulfilled but still wanting more. For dessert there we got tiramisu and rum cake. I probably would have passed on the cake had it not been on the prix fixe menu. However, given they have other new seasonal options I might have gone for something else like a yuzu sorbet had it been on the menu then. Overall, Toca is just an amazing dining experience from the elegant restaurant, to the fantastic and friendly service, and the mouth watering food. I'd highly recommend everyone go at least once. I'm personally checking my day planner for when I will have an opportunity to drop by again. One small criticism is their chair leather is falling apart.

The reason for the 4 stars is that we paid for bottled water and the waiter poured the rest in my wife's glass where she had a soda pop and then gave me tap water.\",\n",

Zero alcohol. The service wasn't that great. Our server forgot about us for most of our time there, and to be honest, the food was just OK.  If I'm gonna spend that kind of money I would expect the food/service to be a lot better.

Service is seamless and ensures a comfortable meal. We took the opportunity during a recent celebration to come for a meal. Do not be fooled by the simple white nondescript entrance, as the restaurant is expansive inside with a dark cozy atmosphere. Think dark woods and dim lighting. We had the croquettes, french onion soup, the porterhouse steak, and strawberry cheesecake to finish. Everything from start to finish was perfectly executed. The porterhouse steak was of course the standout, as every bite was medium rare and delicious. A wonderful place to have a memorable meal!\",\n",

Lighting was dark as expected, maybe a bit too dark.  We shared a 24oz rib steak with some side dishes.  Steak was cooked to perfection, perfectly juicy, enjoyed the cut.  Seasoning was mild with the Barberian's steak seasoning.  Service was good without being amazing given how tight it was in there with tables fairly close together.  The sides were garlic bread (amazing!), fries, button mushrooms, and their traditional pickled vegetables (also amazing! and provided to every table - nice touch).  We would go back but in a larger group, clientele were mostly regulars, there were certainly no Instagram influencers here and that was refreshing for a change.\",\n",

By US standards, not too large, but it was cooked perfectly and had a nice flavor.  I found the wine list light on reasonably priced options, though we did have a very nice Frank Family Zinfindal.  My only disappointment was a side order of sautéed onions, which weren't very good.  They were not caramelized and not even cut well, had big half circle sections.  The steak, though, made it an excellent evening.\",\n",

We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for a table since we didn't get a chance to make a reservation, which was a mistake. Make sure to have a reservation if you plan on dining here. This place was packed, probably because of how good the food is! The restaurant looks quite eccentric, with lots of colours and tropical decor. Makes you feel like you are eating in Thailand! It is on the smaller side, however, so you'll be very close to your neighbouring tables. We ended up sitting on the outside patio since there was no space inside. We ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and the Khao Pad (Pineapple Fried Rice with Chicken). The Chicken Pad Thai was probably the best Pad Thai that I've had for sure. It was super flavourful, and the side of peanuts is such a great addition to a Pad Thai. The only thing was that there was a too many bean sprouts (I usually prefer more noodles over bean sprouts). The coconut sticky rice that comes with the fried rice was SO GOOD. The chicken was super spicy (probably should have ordered mild), but the coconut rice does a good job of cooling your mouth down.\",\n",

              " \"We felt like Thai for dinner and decided to visit this neighborhood joint, and we're far from disappointed! The place had an amazing Thai vibe, two floors and a patio that was jam packed with patrons. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, but there were so many places just outside to look at. We started with the coconut soup, with chicken. The aroma with such a milk infusion of lemon grass, citrus and coconut hits your face as the waiter places in front of you, and I have to admit that's when I started heavily salivating. The soup was loaded with fresh chicken slices, and topped with coriander, great combination, and a little on the spicy side, just how we like it. I had the Thai ice tea, and it really does taste like what they make in Thailand, there was a delicate balance of herbs, a robust tea taste, and the sweet creaminess of the condensed milk, wow, perfection! I would highly recommend this if your into Thai ice tea. In fact I would probably go back just to have this with their mango sticky rice (which I've had at a previous dinner here). Our appetizer came, warm, crispy, and loaded with filling. The tofu roll had a good amount of shrimp, and other items, this was also spicy, but it came with a sweet cause to dip into, which was a good complimentary flavour for the rolls and balanced the spice in them. The last item we ordered was the pineapple chicken curry, which I think was ok. I know this is one of those dishes that people rave about, but I honestly didn't understand the hype here. Thought I've been here several Times previously, and thoroughly enjoyed my meals, this is the one time I wished I had ordered something else. The pineapple chunks were not sweet, they were kind of salty, and the curry wasn't very balanced in their spice profile. I was quite surprised, as this restaurant has always previously been 100% impressive for all of our dishes. However, the coconut rice was exactly as I remember, super fresh, and absolutely delicious! The service from start to finish was great, staff were knowledgeable, and when you asked for opinions of food choices, they didn't recommend the most expensive menu item, but did just speak to us about the entire list of appetizers (I wish they narrowed it down for us though). We can't wait to be back!\",\n",

The pad Thai I would go there just for this alone! The tofu was well marinated, and the flavours of the pad Thai were just so well infused with great spices and sauces, such a well made meal! The veggie mix was also well infused with flavour, and the tofu was nicely marinated before it was thrown into this dish. I can't really tell what the flavours were, but they all just worked well together. I can understand why more people are converting to being vegetarian, when food is so well made, I can't wait to go back here to try out the rest of this menu!\",\n",

The food we ordered came out very fast (not sure if they're always like this or they prioritized us because we had to leave promptly. The pad see ew was very good with nice soy sauce flavour among other spices with a decent amount of vege and chicken.  But the pad Thai was the show stopper for me. It was AMAZING.

So I made a reservation for Saturday dinner. The restaurant was small and fun! There were decorations all around. My boyfriend and I arrived before my friend did, so we checked-in at our reservation time and requested to be seated at the patio. The staff were friendly and helpful- they suggested a few popular items off the menu and kindly reminded us about the time limit for dining. While waiting, we ordered two drinks, Jas-mi-peach and Thai green tea. Both drinks were lightly sweet and refreshing! When my friend arrived, we ordered our mains: My boyfriend ordered Tom Yum with chicken and two Mii Pu (for takeout). My friend ordered Khao Soi with braised beef and I ordered the same one with veggies and tofu. The portion size was very generous- it could be shared between two people! Khao Soi was delicious, the noodles were lightly chewy, the broth was a bit spicy, the veggies and tofu pieces were well-cooked. My friend and boyfriend said they also enjoyed their meal. Due to the time limit to dine, we weren't able to enjoy eating and talking as much. Despite that, we had a good time. A few tips: - Make a reservation early! Time slots fill out fast. -There is a time limit for dining (90 minutes), so read the menu and decide beforehand - The seating (outside and inside) are very tight- bring the least amount of belongings.

She gave us a few minutes, so that we can decide what to order. The place was decorated beautifully, the walls were covered with tropical-themed artworks. The lighting fixtures were cool and modern.

It was presented beautifully as well. I've never tried Tom Yum Pad Thai before, I didn't know what to expect. It was lightly spicy- the noodles were cooked to perfection, the vegetables were cooked well, and the roasted peanuts provided crunchiness to the meal.

I've never had haggis before but had a preconception that it was pretty awful but this haggis changed my mind. Scotland's national dish of lamb, oats and spices on a bed of mashed turnip and potatoes. It was well seasoned and tasted delicious! The texture was of ground meat. Nothing binding it together, I don't think. Knife not required. The crisps on the top were welcomed to contrast the texture of the smooth mash. They do have vegetarian options here too. The tasting itself was wonderful. A representative from Tomintoul presented to us their 4 whiskies: 10, 12, 16 and peated. He went through a brief history and process of making the whiskey in which we ended each segment with a nosing and tasting of each whiskey starting with the 10 year.

What a let down... .but that just went to prove how popular the dish is.. We decided to dine at the restaurant anyways and were seated by a pleasant host in the back, cozy patio. I asked for the Scotch egg appetizer right away since I remembered it being delicious.. It was tastier than before and the little salad that came on the same plate had a very nice, slightly sweet dressing on it.. As for my entree, I couldn't decide if I should go for the butter chicken because it is usually too sweet and creamy in the Indian restaurants I have had it at. Anyway, I thought I would try it and ...it has my vote for the best butter chicken in town!!  Chicken thighs were used, perhaps, but at least it was not breast meat which is served in most Indian restaurants. And it was the right spicyness ..

Turns out there's another section at the back that opens up to a lovely patio. The customers out back seemed to be enjoying themselves and I retracted my first impression.

I've only had a Scotch egg one other time at a carnival so I wasn't sure what to expect. The Scotch egg was delicious! It wasn't too salty and paired nicely with the salad. I'm not much of a salad eater. My fish and chips was decent. I have fond memories of fish and chips in the UK and this wasn't quite the same. The steak in my friend's steak pie was so flavourful and tender. A lot of the time I've had dry and not tasty meat in pies such as this. When it came time to pay I reached inside my backpack for my wallet and found that the lid on my container of cherries had popped off. There were mushed cherries at the bottom of my backpack, it was quite gross. The waitress saw the displeasure on my face and when I asked for a couple of napkins she offered to wet a couple for me. What service! She even got me a ziplock bag so that my cherries would not create more of a mess for me. The service was impeccable and sitting at the back enjoying the atmosphere was lovely.

This place specializes in game meats and I was initially teetering between the bison ribeye or the wild boar steak and was wondering which one would be more gamey. The waitress was very helpful in my decision and I'm happy to report that I didn't taste any gamey-ness at all in the ribeye. Everything in that dish melded together very well. From the tenderness of the bison ribeye to the flavorful polenta and plentiful kale/rapini mixture, I found myself wanting more and more after each bite. It was just done, really really well. My partner had the confit duck leg and that was a treat as well. The duck was also very flavorful and tasty. The only thing that threw us off was there was hint of horseradish in the butternut squash puree that kind of ruined the flavor of the risotto for us. We would get flavors of good and savory and then random bouts of horseradish that just did not mesh well. Aside from the mains, I also got the duck heart yakitori appetizer and that was unfortunately a miss for me. That was the only thing that lacked flavor for me. Could have used some salt?

Sending a bill to Doug Ford for an open keg which they can't use due to flip flopping of covid rules, the chef cooking meat in front of vegan protesters... They have character. 3 of us came here for dinner on a Tuesday, we luckily had reservations as the place was full. Ambiance (4 stars) We were seated outside, the back patio is 4 tables with wooden fencing around it. Nothing pretty but comfortable. Inside it was also on the smaller side, cozy. Service: (5 stars) Good service, working with you to find cocktails you like. Drinks: Duck a L'orange (5 stars): the best cocktail I tried here. Very smooth with an undertone of vanilla. Made with duck fat. We tried smoked barrel (4 stars) and lady marmalade(3 stars) as well. They were good, but cannot compare to Duck a L'orange. Food: ANTLER TRUFFLE BRIE - (4 stars) It was good, but nothing amazing DUCK HEART YAKITORI (4 stars) - the duck hearts were just ok, but the sauce and the scallions were outstanding. BISON RIB EYE (4.5 stars) - very well cooked, the mushrooms were amazing. ONTARIO VENISON LOIN (4 stars) - a bit salty, but otherwise very pleasant. Deserts: MAPLE TART (4 stars) - would order it again STRAWBERRY SEMIFREDDO (3 stars) - almost a pallet cleanser. SMOKED CHOCOLATE MOUSSE (5 stars) - comes with a smoke bowl on top, a heavy desert, great for sharing.  Desert comes with a presentation. Next time I would go for Duck a L'orange drink and the burger.\",\n",

Although they recommend medium rare ; I'd advise getting medium for the bison steak . I had a hard time cutting the steak at medium rare. Also if you get the bison steak make sure you're hungry ; it's really filling (not complaining about that ; happy to be full :) ) Also friendly and accommodating staff ; I asked for them to cook my steak further ; not only did they do that but they also gave me an extra serving of mushrooms !

The bison ribeye was worth all $58 and then some. I'll be looking forward to getting that again for next time. They were even so sweet about my rapini intolerance (rip, I will miss you sweet delicious rapini.) AND THE FEATURE DESSERT!!! It was clementine cheesecake. It was light delicious, and fresh. It tasted like pure clementine, we even watched another table taste it to see how they'd react, and they were also delighted. Excited to come back, the wine was great and so were the cocktails.

I highly recommend doing reservations a week or at least a few days in advance if you're planning to do a weekend night. Pizza Oro: Good portions of toppings and the pizza sauce were delicious. The pizza was thin but wasn't too soggy with the toppings. Rigatoni al Funghi: The sauce was good, lots of flavour with the white truffle sauce. Great option if you're already a fan of rigatoni. Calamari Fritti: Different breading they use for the calamari, which was still crispy yet light which is a nice change from other places. The portions were decent to share with a group of friends. The service was good despite being a busy weekend night. Only downside that the seating is a bit tight that you might likely end up being near the door, but besides that, it's totally worth coming. My new favourite spots for Italian food in the Downtown area.\",\n",

I came on a weekend night so it was pretty busy, highly recommend getting a reservation beforehand. Since I came with no reservation, I ended up eating at the bar side which was still okay but definitely more ideal to book reservations in advance if you're coming with a group. Tonnarelli: Deliciously creamy and was the perfect amount of flavour. The flavour was quite rich that other additional toppings weren't needed. Pappardelle: Great pasta noodles and nice tomato sauce. It was quite delicious and loved how much flavour there was. It's a great spot for delicious pasta at a reasonable price point. I really liked how both kinds of pastas weren't overwhelming and still filled with flavour. The place is a bit on the small side and tight on seating so reservations are necessary, I got lucky that there were some spots to still sit at the bar seats. Overall, great service and would return to try out more dishes, especially the pizza!\",\n",

Arancini we're not warm all the way through, cold in the centre - never experienced something like this at any other restaurant I've been to. The sauce with Arancini is good, but come on... Food needs to be cooked (or at least microwaved) properly. We got the prosciutto pizza and didn't expect to get a soggy piece of dough with cold toppings on top - very strange that the dough is warm and everything else on the pizza is cold like it came from a fridge. The waitress was quiet and awkward. Place looks simple and nice, but it didn't live up to all of its reviews with the cold food. Won't be back.\",\n",

Came by for dinner on a Sunday night and got the following: - Arancini di Asparagi - Penne Gamberi - forget the name, but their daily pizza special similar which was like a carbonara pizza Everything was fresh and came out piping hot. My favourite was the pasta with the rose sauce and large juicy shrimps, which I wish there was more of. The pizza, while not soggy was a bit tough but enjoyable nonetheless. The staff were super friendly and made sure to explain everything as we ordered and got the food. We got a gelato at the end which was a nice ending to a wonderful meal.',\n",

The seating area of the restaurant was rather limited but had a good view of the open kitchen. Food came fast, service was okay. Barbabitole - Was heavy, but delicious. There was a generous amount of buffalo ricotta which was super fatty and rich. Candied beats and vincotta was delicious as it offset the ricotta fattiness. Pistachio was a good touch as it added a crunch to the cheese and cooked beats. Delicious, would recommend! Pizza Oro - A thin crust pizza with a lot of toppings: 3 different sausages, garlic, basil, cheese. The contents of the pizza was only okay, if felt like too many things happening at once. Or the sausages don't have much flavor or the ingredients was not spread out well. The dough was a bit disappointing. The crust was too dry and burnt for my taste. The bottom of the pizza was cooked, but I would have expected a bit more toasted. Based on this pizza experience, I'd order a pasta next time.\",\n",

If you've never had potatoes on a pizza, it definitely works. Toppings were generous, crust was buttered goodness. - Pappardelle Osso Buccu: Tender braised veal, perfectly al dente pasta, generous serving. Loved it. - Cozze: Ok sized mussels (and lots of them), really tasty tomato sauce. Service was super friendly and spot-on with suggestions. Price is fair. It's in an old building so a bit warm in the summer. Overall, a great Italian treat in the area.\",\n",

The pizza had a good char on the bottom from being fired in the wood oven I presume, it was thin but had ample toppings. The pasta was the favourite! The pasta was perfectly al dente, it had such a rich and deep mushroom flavour, all the while not being too heavy with the cream.

I thought the place was pretty small, until our name was called and we were led to a table by a friendly young lady. The place was huge- there were multiple sections and each section had its own decor! Our seat was at the end section, where the decor reminded us of sitting inside someone's home. Our server was a second friendly young lady. She warmly greeted us and showed us the menu (QR code). She said she'll be back to take our order in a few minutes. To start, we ordered Shrimp Chips and two Thai Ice Tea. For the main, I picked Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken. My friend chose Khao Soi with beef. A few minutes later, the Shrimp Chips and two Thai Ice Tea came to us. The Shrimp Chips were delicious- they were crispy and lightly salty. The Thai Ice Tea was tasty- it tasted like milk tea with deeper tea flavour. Then our mains came and we couldn't wait to eat! For my meal, the blend of veggies, chewy noodles, and the chicken pieces were delicious- however it was a bit salty. My friend enjoyed her meal as well- she said that she liked the smooth coconut curry with blend of spices and the juicy pieces of beef.

              "[(\"My friend and I wanted to catch up over dinner on a Saturday evening, and she picked this place (as she read great reviews). We didn't have a reservation, so we waited in line and the friendly staff at the front took down one of our names. Then we were informed that it would be about . While waiting, we looked around- the vibe was energetic and fun, the customers were eating and laughing. The decor was cool- the lights were dimmed, there were various colourful objects all around to evoke a comfy feel. I thought the place was pretty small, until our name was called and we were led to a table by a friendly young lady. The place was huge- there were multiple sections and each section had its own decor! Our seat was at the end section, where the decor reminded us of sitting inside someone's home. Our server was a second friendly young lady. She warmly greeted us and showed us the menu (QR code). She said she'll be back to take our order in a few minutes. To start, we ordered Shrimp Chips and two Thai Ice Tea. For the main, I picked Chef Nuit Pad Thai with chicken. My friend chose Khao Soi with beef. A few minutes later, the Shrimp Chips and two Thai Ice Tea came to us. The Shrimp Chips were delicious- they were crispy and lightly salty. The Thai Ice Tea was tasty- it tasted like milk tea with deeper tea flavour. Then our mains came and we couldn't wait to eat! For my meal, the blend of veggies, chewy noodles, and the chicken pieces were delicious- however it was a bit salty. My friend enjoyed her meal as well- she said that she liked the smooth coconut curry with blend of spices and the juicy pieces of beef. Throughout our meal, our server came by to check-in on us to make sure that we had everything we needed. The portions were generous and the dishes and drinks were delicious! Highly recommended!\",\n",
              "  'positive'),\n",
              " (\"- excellent chips! - pad thai was spicy (level: spicy, but not thai spicy) with  - fried shrimp was excellent - really good pineapple juice The venue is huge, fun, and has good vibes. Food came out fast and the portions were large. It's got an upbeat party-type vibe here and is a LOT bigger than it looks. Prices were reasonable, on the higher end of Thai in general. Excellent food nonetheless. Shame there was no thai iced coffee.\",\n",

              " (\"My friend loves this restaurant. Me, well, it's just ok for me. #. People waiting by the tables to be seated makes it very uncomfortable dining experience. #. Host said no chance to switch to a regular table. Very uncomfortable. No where to put our coats, purses. Our feet just dangled. #. Very tasty. Curry dish came with rice. That was good. We also ordered Pad Thai which was also good. The other dish was with ground pork and served with rice and an egg. It was just ok for me. #. I like my food served really hot so who knows how long our food sat under warmers before it was served. #. Our food was not spicy at all...even tho we ordered our dishes spicy. On the positive side the server was good. Don't know if I would return.\",\n",

              " ('Friday night dinner. Tried to book . They have limited reservations available to welcome more walk-in guests. So, took a chance and waited in line to get a table. Seated in . Already a long line up in front of the restaurant around 5:30pm. This Michelin mentioned restaurant is giving the street and the eat-in area an exciting vibe with full of energy. We are group of 5. Ordered Food: # THAI CHICKEN WINGS # GRABONG (buttercup squash fritters ) # MOO PING (grilled pork skewers) # GAENG KIAW WAN - GREEN CURRY (Chicken) # GAENG MASSAMAN (Beef) # PAD SEE EW (Shrimp) Highlight was Pad See Ew. Loved the Wide flat noodle. Great texture with chewiness and tenderness. The wide surface noodle absorbs savory flavors, making a great contrast with the plumpy large shrimps and crispy baby gailan (Chinese broccoli). The presentation of the green curry was impressive - the curry was in the coconut shell. Tasted great with generous amount of vegetables and meat, rich in textures and flavors. The accompanying jasmine rice was perfectly steamed, wrapped in a leaf. Flavorful. Compared to the amount of the curry, I wished the size of the rice were bigger. You can order the rice separately for $4. Sweet with mild spice kick. The wings, pork skewers, Massaman curry and Grabong all tasted great. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to note as \"wow\". Drinks (Cocktails) # GOJI ANUNOBY (Vodka, Grande Marnier, Domain de Canton, Plum Wine,Plum Bitters, Goji Pop Tea, Goji Berries.) # THAI MOJITO (White Rum, Lemongrass Syrup, fresh basil, lime, topped with Soda and butterfly pea flower) # RED PAI SANGRIA (Malbec, Grand Marnier, lychees, fresh pineapple, pomegranate juice, lime) All the cocktails had unique Thai flavors with distinctive use of herbs and spices, fruits. Everything hit a good balance of sour, and exotic scent and fruitiness. They all maintained nice boozy kick. The amount of food were perfect for . Will come back!!!!!',\n",

              " (\"The place was decorated really well with a tropical theme. It was about an hour wait for our party of . The waiting area is very small, most of my family had to stand. I ordered the chaing Mai beef noodle soup, they give you a good amount of meat, and it was very flavorful. I tried my boyfriend's Khao soi (chicken and noodles in coconut milk curry) and it was so creamy, it the best thing I had eaten all month. I recommend dining here, and definitely make a reservation ahead of time.\",\n",

              " (\"We went here on a Thursday to get in line around 11:50am. This restaurant doesn't open until 12pm and there was already a line before it opened! We got the Gaeng Massaman, Chef Built Pad Thai, and Thai Chicken Wings. I also wanted to order dessert too, but they don't serve dessert until after 4pm, so I only ended up getting those food items. Anyways, all the food was good, but it wasn't the best Thai food I've had. The food were very average in flavor. The Thai Chicken Wings were my favorite part though! Those chicken wings were covered were crispy, well marinated, and juicy! Another positive thing about my experience with the food here was the large portion size of the pad Thai! We shared the pad Thai and that made us full. The Gaeng Massaman curry dish we got was good too and I liked how the curry wasn't too thick. I'd recommend this place, but maybe only during their dinner hours. I recommend to come during the dinner hours because then you'll be able to try their dessert menu while also being able to order from their food menu too! I also wish this place had more variety of food items since it didn't feel like much variety when I went.\",\n",

Is it all hype or is it \"Worth It?\" I loved the Mango Slaw as I found it refreshing. I loved the textures of the sweetness of the mangos with the crunchiness of the taro sticks and peanuts. It is a must get, in my book. Hubby and I decided to go vegetarian for our entrees. Hubby ordered Tofu Pad Gra Prow which was very good while I ordered Tofu Khao Soi. There was a perfect balance between the curry and soup. The harmonious coconut milk with the stock made it the standout dish with its refreshing combination of flavors and textures. I truly appreciate the notion that they offer plenty of vegetarian food and can make any dish vegan. This is a trendy place and you should make reservations on Friday nights as well as the weekends.
